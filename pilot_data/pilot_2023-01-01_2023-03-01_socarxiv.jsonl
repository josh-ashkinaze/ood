They have to adjust academically and must integrate into a new social environment. Successful social integration is important for university students\u2019 academic success and well-being. Previous studies illustrate that personality traits shape social behavior. However, research on the impact of personality traits on social integration in the university context is scarce. In this study, we investigate how students\u2019 Big Five personality traits influence the level and development of their social integration. We analyze whether the fit of the students\u2019 Big Five profile with their chosen major affects their social integration. We differentiate social integration with teaching staff and social integration with fellow students. We use the student cohort of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) for our analysis. We observed students for up to four academic years and estimated growth curve models with random intercept and random slope. The results show that all Big Five traits are significantly associated with both forms of social integration at the end of the first academic year, with the exception of extraversion and openness. While extraversion is only significant for social integration with fellow students, openness is only relevant for social integration with teaching staff. A poor person-environment fit regarding personality is significantly negatively linked to both forms of social integration at the end of the first academic year. However, the Big Five traits and person-environment fit affect the level of social integration only but not the development of social integration.","tags":["Big Five","social integration","higher education","university students","personality traits","person-environment fit"],"date":"2023-01-01T11:19:46.203724","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychology","Sociology","Personality and Social Contexts","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/p7tq5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/p7tq5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/p7tq5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/p7tq5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_0"}

Despite growing knowledge of racial injustice in exposure levels, less is known about the relationship between the production of and exposure to such pollution. This study assesses pollution burden by testing whether local populations' vehicular air pollution exposure is proportional to how much they drive. Through a Los Angeles, California case study we examine how this relates to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status---and how these relationships vary across the region. We find that, all else equal, tracts whose residents drive less are exposed to more air pollution, as are tracts with a less-White population. Commuters from majority-White tracts disproportionately drive through non-White tracts, compared to the inverse. Decades of racially-motivated freeway infrastructure planning and residential segregation shape today's disparities in who produces vehicular air pollution and who is exposed to it, but opportunities exist for urban planning and transport policy to mitigate this injustice.","tags":["commuting","highways","spatial analysis","air pollution","healthy cities","air quality","transport policy","geographically weighted regression","public health","transportation planning","driving","simulation","poverty","travel behavior","urban planning","urban analytics","urban informatics","pollution","racial justice","freeways","los angeles","transportation engineering","urban geography","transport","urban science","social justice","environmental justice","infrastructure","ethnicity","urban design","urban data science","urban policy","transport justice"],"date":"2023-01-01T17:01:13.003271","doi":"10.1177\/00420980221145403","subjects":["Spatial Science","Public Policy","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Infrastructure","Health Policy","Geography","Urban Studies and Planning","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Policy","Human Geography","Geographic Information Sciences","Social Welfare"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wd92j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/wd92j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/wd92j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wd92j","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/00420980221145403","dataset_id":"socarxiv_1"}

In this paper, we document women\u2019s experiences of under-five mortality in 50 low- and middle-income countries, focusing comprehensively on experiences in their immediate natal or conjugal family in the form of sibling or offspring death. Specifically, we analyze Demographic and Health Survey Program data on 1.05 million women spanning three decadal birth cohorts to document women\u2019s life-course exposure to under-five sibling or offspring death, the intergenerational clustering of these experiences, and how they are (not) changing across cohorts. The results show an exceedingly high, and often stable, percentage of women have experienced under-five sibling and offspring deaths. Moreover, women\u2019s risk of offspring death is often strongly associated with their history of sibling death; this strong intergenerational clustering has remained stable, or has grown larger, across cohorts in most countries.","tags":["maternal bereavement","under-five mortality","Demographic transitions","intergenerational transmission"],"date":"2023-01-01T21:15:03.182118","doi":null,"subjects":["Population","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xvbkj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/xvbkj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/xvbkj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xvbkj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_2"}

Building on previous structural analyses, which reveal that Indus script was semasiographic or logographic in nature, this study analyses the combinatorial patterns of Indus script signs, and the geographical distribution of the inscriptions, to establish that the inscriptions did not encode any proper noun, such as anthroponyms, toponyms, or names of specific organizations. Analysing various archaeological contexts of the inscribed objects \u2014e.g., seals are found concentrated near city gates (e.g., Harappa), craft-workshops (e.g., Chanhu-daro), and public buildings (e.g., Mohenjo-daro), often along with standardized Indus weights which were used for taxation; sealings were attached to various storage containers and locking systems of \u201cwarehouse\u201d chambers as indicated by their  reverse side impressions (e.g., the Lothal \u201cwarehouse\u201d sealings); inscribed sealing-pendants of Kanmer are conjectured to be  passports\/gate-passes by  archaeologists; seals with identical inscriptions are often found from distant settlements \u2014 this study claims that the inscribed stamp-seals were used for enforcing certain rules involving taxation, trade\/craft control, commodity-control and access control. Considering typological and functional differences between the seals and tablets, and analysing certain numerical and metrological notations ( ,  ,  ) typically found at the reverse-sides of many multi-sided tablets whose obverse-sides contain seal-like inscriptions, this study argues that such tablets were possibly trade\/craft\/commodity specific licenses issued to tax-collectors, traders, and artisans. These reverse-side tablet-inscriptions possibly encoded certain standardized license-fees for three popular license-slabs, whereas their obverse sides specified the commercial activities licensed to the tablet-bearers. These seals\/tablets were possibly issued by certain merchant-guilds or artisan-guilds, and city-based or territorial governments, who collaborated in the integration phase of IVC, to standardize certain taxation-rules and trade-regulations across settlements.

The reason why adolescents do not achieve such a fit might not lie alone in anticipated labor-market barriers or their school achievement but also in their vocational interests. Based on Gottfredson\u2019s (1981) theory on the circumscription of occupational aspirations, I test whether there are vocational interests for which circumscription processes do not leave adolescents with a selection of acceptable occupations they can aspire to that also fit their vocational interests. Descriptive analyses based on the German Microcensus provide information on occupations primary RIASEC code based on Holland (1997) and their gender composition and social class (socio-economic status and educational composition). These analyses show that adolescents with realistic and investigative interests should seldomly be able to aspire to occupations that simultaneously conform to all three aspects of their self-concept, which consists of their gender, social class, and their vocational interests.

{"osf_id":"vh4dm","title":"The contribution of partnership contexts of births to cohort fertility rates","description":"Partnering behavior is central to understanding fertility. Influential concepts, including singlehood, serial monogamy, and multiple-partner fertility, are frequently used to analyze the interplay between partnering and fertility at the individual level. However, these frameworks are also evoked to understand population-level patterns. One fundamental population-level pattern for gauging the relationship between partnerships and childbearing, we argue, is the enumeration of fertility as the sum of births under various partnership conditions. Surprisingly, demographers rarely measure and have not yet a clear picture of the extent to which childbearing in different partnership contexts contributes to completed fertility. We analyze Finnish register data to decompose the cohort fertility rate (CFR) into births from eight partner contexts, in conjunction with three dimensions: union status, union order, and reproductive partner order. Somewhat contrary to discourse of partnering in the Nordics, we conclude that births within first unions to first reproductive partners account for two-thirds of CFR. Births in higher-order unions to first reproductive partners account for one-fifth. Single births and births with higher-order reproductive partners have a modest impact. This ranking holds across sex and educational level, with substantive relative differences. We argue that these descriptions provide an additional perspective to appraise childbearing and partnering dynamics.","tags":["union dissolution","union formation","Finland","Cohort fertility","Fertility"],"date":"2023-01-03T14:45:00.251965","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Population","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Children and Youth","Sexualities","Family"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vh4dm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/vh4dm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/vh4dm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vh4dm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_9"}

We argue that this camp provides a unique opportunity to observe the sociability of adolescents in well-bounded settings with equalized meeting opportunities, thus helping us to narrow down the specific role of homophilic selection - the process by which individuals actively select similar friends. We use Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models to analyze the declared friendships of participants. Furthermore, we introduce a novel longitudinal extension of the Exponential Random Partition Model (ERPM), a class of model meant for relational data organized in discrete groups, which we apply to observed meal-sharing among adolescents. Results point to weak to non-existent homophilic selection during the stay. In turn, this suggests that structural opportunities and contextual moderators might be essential in explaining the amount of socioeconomic homophily found at school or in other contexts.","tags":["partition model","summer camp","socioeconomic homophily","friendship networks","adolescent groups","stochastic actor-oriented model"],"date":"2023-01-03T19:23:04.037968","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fq2jh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/fq2jh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/fq2jh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fq2jh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_10"}

Over recent years the facet and the aspect of teaching translation in tertiary and college education have changed. In the knowledge era, the traditional lecture method of teaching translation has been replaced by web 2.0 technology such as weblogs. The current research paper mainly purports to extrapolate the perceptions of written translations of female students toward the effect of utilizing the weblog technology to enhance their written translation performance and to evidence the merits of employing the weblog in translation learning and practice. The critical significance of this study is how perceived weblogs\u2019 effects on improving written translation performance. The main question of this study is: what type of perceptions do translation students have towards the impact of utilizing weblog technology to enhance their written translation performance? Moreover, to accomplish the objective of the study, the two researchers used a descriptive research method. Information gathering was collected by a questionnaire of fifteen items based on a four-point Likert Scale. Fifty students were selected randomly from King Khalid University,  Saudi  Arabia, majoring in translation. The study evinces that female students of written translation have a positive attitude toward applying weblogs in registered translation classes. The study also shows that there is development in translation for female students\u2019 written translation performance to translate innovatively and artistically. It has been found that utilizing the weblog technology in written translation has many merits.

Theories of teaching grammar in a foreign language are vital as they allow EFL teachers to build a frame for language learners. Grammar instruction is a bridge that links learners with other skills and if their grammar competence is vulnerable, the whole language production will be weak too. This study seeks to understand and review language theories that underlie daily grammar teaching. Many of EFL\/ESL teachers teach grammar without a solid understanding of the language theories that inform their actual teaching practices and methodologies. This paper sheds light on the linguistics theories underlying grammar teaching methodologies in most English as foreign language classes and textbooks.

This study employed a case study of seven Archaeology Master One students at Tlemcen University (Algeria) to investigate this research . First, these students\u2019 needs were identified and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively through a questionnaire and three structured interviews.  The findings in this research permit the researcher to suggest an English course with appropriate syllabus and adequate tasks. The results revealed that in terms of learning needs, archaeology students were highly motivated to learn English, yet they lacked self-confidence. Regarding the target needs, archaeology students needed to develop the four language skills and required to complete appropriate English language tasks to achieve communicative purposes.

{"osf_id":"trhj6","title":"The Effect of Online Interaction via Microsoft Teams Private Chat on Enhancing the Communicative Competence of   Introverted Students","description":"The history of language education has witnessed the emergence of various approaches and methods to circumvent learning difficulties. Some of them were very effective and continue to be popular, whereas others were short-lived and less effective. The latest trend is technology-enhanced language learning, which became necessary during the recent pandemic. As a result, various learning platforms were created and tested to enhance online education. Despite the apparent disadvantages of online learning, it has undoubtedly produced a positive impact on learning styles. A notable change is the possibilities for individualised instruction and self-learning, which can provide additional support to introverted students. The major challenges introverted students face in second language acquisition are low self-esteem, lack of motivation and high anxiety. These negative attitudes often hinder successful language learning. However, one of the latest learning platforms, MS Teams Meeting, offers an additional feature for interaction known as Private Chat, which enables learners to communicate with their teachers and peers without disrupting the regular class. Besides, it helps students regulate the learning process according to their preferred time and pace and get extended one-on-one support from teachers. Moreover, this technology-based interactive tool facilitates asynchronous learning, thus enabling introverted students to overcome learning difficulties that act as affective filters and become independent learners. This small-scale experimental study shows that the use of Microsoft Private Chat for teacher-student interaction significantly contributes to the communicative competence of introverted students as it helps lower anxiety and boosts motivation and self-confidence.","tags":["introverted students","online interaction","communicative competence","Microsoft Teams Private Chat","learning styles"],"date":"2023-01-04T01:40:05.199725","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.8","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/trhj6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/trhj6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/trhj6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/trhj6","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.8","dataset_id":"socarxiv_18"}

With the growing demand for English learing, over the last 30 years, the topic of Native English-Speaking Teachers and Non-Native English-Speaking Teachers has become a topic of debate. Thus, the purpose of the current mixed method study was to find out students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perceptions and attitudes towards NESTs and NNESTs in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Since students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 attitudes and perceptions have not been explored about this issue, this study might benefit learners, teachers, stakeholders, and recruiters. In the study, student questionnaires and teacher interviews were administered to answer the following research question: What are students\u2019 and instructors\u2019 perceptions and attitudes towards NESTs and NNESTs, and what strengths and weaknesses do they identify about NESTs and NNESTs? The participants were 345 university students, and 24 EFL teachers. The quantitative data obtained from the student questionnaire were analyzed through SPSS V. 25, and the qualitative data from the teacher interviews were analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings revealed that the students prefer NESTs over NNESTs. However, they also showed positive attitudes towards NNESTs. Similarly, the teachers believed that NESTs and NNESTs have their positives and negatives. The NESTs were preferred for being fluent, natural speakers, and being better at colloquial language. In contrast, NNESTs were thought to excel at having a stronger connection with students, being sympathetic, and understanding students\u2019 needs and difficulties.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-04T01:42:33.887991","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.9","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xn5uc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/xn5uc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/xn5uc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xn5uc","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.9","dataset_id":"socarxiv_19"}
{"osf_id":"cejsz","title":"Evaluating the Cognitive Dimension of Translation in Light of the Six Phases Proposed by Wilss (1996) in the Decision-Making Process: A Case Study","description":"The present paper addresses the evaluation of the cognitive dimension of translation considering the six phases proposed by Wilss (1996) in the decision-making process. Its importance springs from the fact that it is pivotal to view translation as a cognitive activity rather than a mere linguistic process and evaluate it by carrying out cognitive analysis based on the six phases propounded by Wilss (1996) in the decision-making process. This is particularly useful in understanding the mental processes operating in the cognitive system of the translator through the pitfalls he\/she has in his\/her translation, which epitomize the translation problems that he\/she has encountered during the translation process. The paper seeks to answer the following main research question: how can the cognitive dimension of translation in light of the six phases proposed by Wilss (1996) in the decision-making process be evaluated? The paper draws on Wilss\u2019s model to provide a cognitive analysis of English-Arabic translation. The paper argues that any pitfall the translator has had in her translation typifies failure of identifying the translation problem cognitively, which is the first phase proposed by Wilss in the decision-making process. Hence failure of passing the first phase brings about failure of completing all the phases for cognitive analysis. The pitfalls that represent the translation problems can be categorized into five categories, namely: the use of inappropriate equivalence, culture-specific elements, translation by omission, translation by addition and the use of borrowing in a dialect of Arabic. Each category features the translation issue, the cognitive analysis conducted thereon and the recommended translation(s).","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-04T01:45:30.864655","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.10","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cejsz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/cejsz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/cejsz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cejsz","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.10","dataset_id":"socarxiv_20"}

{"osf_id":"4ur37","title":"The Influence of Product Gender on Frequency of Code-switching in Online Advertisements: A Study on the Saudi Digital Marketing Platform Maroof","description":"Code-switching can be a successful marketing strategy in online advertisements even when the targeted audience is monolingual. Yet, little research was conducted on its frequency or attitudes towards it, especially in the Middle Eastern context. Additionally, most current research on code-switching is on bilingual communities. Such gaps in the literature contribute to the significance of the current study. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to investigate whether gender is a factor influencing both the frequency and the preferences of code-switching in online written advertisements listed on Maroof, a Saudi governmental platform for verifying local online shops. Two questions were formulated to determine if code-switching frequency in advertisements for male and female products is statistically different and to check whether the targeted recipients have different code-choice preferences depending on the gender for which the product is made. A textual analysis and an online questionnaire were employed to answer these research questions. Fifty randomly selected online shops containing products for women were compared with fifty other shops advertising men\u2019s products. The advertisements were mostly Arabic monolingual for both groups (82% in men\u2019s products and 76% in women\u2019s products). However, the group of women\u2019s products had a significantly higher frequency of code-switching, with a p-value of 0.46. A questionnaire completed by 936 Saudi respondents revealed that English monolingual advertisements are favored by a considerable number of respondents, despite their complete absence in the sampled advertisements. The questionnaire also revealed that code-switching preferences seem to be influenced by linguistic constraints.","tags":["advertisement","gender","code-switching","digital marketing","Arabic"],"date":"2023-01-04T01:51:49.933224","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.12","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4ur37\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/4ur37\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/4ur37","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4ur37","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.12","dataset_id":"socarxiv_23"}

Furthermore, it attempts to find out the sources from which anxiety stems, as well as to suggest some useful strategies to alleviate students\u2019 anxiety levels. To this end, two research instruments were used. A survey that consists of two sets of questions adapted from the Foreign Language Virtual Classroom Anxiety Scale and Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale was administered to 100 EFL students from different universities in Morocco to gather quantitative data, and interviews that were conducted with 10 students were used to collect qualitative data. In contrast to a traditional class, the study\u2019s findings showed that students in online classes have lower levels of communication anxiety. However, it was discovered that in both learning techniques, students\u2019 feelings of test anxiety and dread of a poor grade remained largely unchanged. Overall, the findings indicated that most Moroccan university students find online classes to be less anxiety-inducing.

Teaching male students of the opposite gender to whom they have not been exposed to prepared before in Saudi Arabia might have an impact on their feelings which may deter them from learning ESL successfully. Therefore, the study aims to answer the main research question; what are the male students\u2019 perceptions of being taught by female ESL teachers in Saudi Arabia? The researcher employed a mixed-method design: A quantitative method, which consists of an ESL test and a 20-item questionnaire, which were distributed among ninety male students in Saudi Arabia to determine their language competence and feelings towards the opposite gender, and a qualitative method, which consists of semi-structured interviews with six ESL teachers and six learners. The study highlights the fact; although teaching male students to females in Saudi Arabia has slightly an impact on their feelings, such as feeling shy and not accepting of them, it does not negatively affect the learning of a second language. However, the efficiency of teaching ESL is the most considerable from the student\u2019s perspective.

To answer the question, this study adopted a survey research design that was quantitative and applied the instrument of two questionnaires. The multiple-choice questionnaire was to investigate their perceptions of C-E translation learning, and the five-Likert scale questionnaire was to seek their self-perceived C-E translation competence. The study was carried out in 2022 among 125 English majors at Zaozhuang University, China. The results showed that most participants recognized the importance of C-E translation and their primary purpose was to enhance bilingual proficiency, and the texts that they were most interested in translating were practical styles and on diverse topics of China. Furthermore, more than half held the active involvement of teachers and learners and over 85% affirmed the effect of group learning and individual learning. It was found that their mean score of self-perceived C-E translation competence was 2.87.","tags":["Chinese context","translation competence","translation learning","English majors","perception","Chinese-English translation"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:13:07.338220","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.19","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f8rjd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/f8rjd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/f8rjd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f8rjd","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.19","dataset_id":"socarxiv_29"}

The study also attempted to explain how Saudi bilingual female students view code-switching in relation to language proficiency and deficiency. A questionnaire and an elicited production task were used to collect data. A sample size of 24 Saudi female students from the English department at King Saud University participated in the questionnaire. In addition, six Saudi female students from the same department were taken for the purpose of carrying out the task. The collected data was analyzed by using percentages, a content analysis technique, and a simple frequency count. Findings and results indicated that there is a correlation between the type of code-switching and language proficiency. The results also revealed that the frequency of code-switching was not related to the level of language proficiency of participants. Positive attitudes towards using code-switching were found among the participants. Based on the results, it could be concluded that code-switching is not a sign of language incompetency. Instead, code-switching is a tool that the majority of participants preferred while speaking with bilinguals.","tags":["Saudi female students","second language bilinguals","language proficiency","code-switching","perception","language deficiency"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:17:23.726664","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.20","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/95v3t\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/95v3t\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/95v3t","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/95v3t","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.20","dataset_id":"socarxiv_30"}
{"osf_id":"4hdaf","title":"The Representation of Vocabulary Knowledge Aspects in Saudi EFL Textbooks","description":"Vocabulary growth is of great importance, and textbooks are the main sources of vocabulary learning for many EFL learners. Previous research has shown that learning vocabulary involves a mastery of several knowledge dimensions. Little research, however, has focused on vocabulary knowledge dimensions in EFL textbooks.  It remains unclear how the different word knowledge dimensions are addressed in Saudi EFL textbooks and whether there is a variation among the textbooks in addressing the different dimensions. The present study aims to fill this gap by investigating how the different vocabulary knowledge dimensions are addressed in the local Saudi EFL textbooks. It investigates the activities in English textbooks that give attention to vocabulary to explore the amount of attention given to each dimension in a particular activity. To achieve this, all the 12 EFL textbooks used in primary and middle Saudi schools were analysed. Applying Nation\u2019s (2013) framework of word knowledge, a total of 1181 activities were examined.  The findings showed that textbooks for primary school levels place greater emphasis on form, followed by meaning and finally use, while in intermediate-level textbooks, the greatest attention is given to meaning, followed by use and then form. The results also reveal variations among the textbooks in the amount of attention given to the different vocabulary knowledge aspects.  Pedagogical implications for textbook writers are suggested.","tags":["vocabulary teaching","English as a foreign language","Saudi EFL textbooks","vocabulary knowledge"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:20:21.065159","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.21","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4hdaf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/4hdaf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/4hdaf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4hdaf","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.21","dataset_id":"socarxiv_31"}
{"osf_id":"rw5d9","title":"Investigating Teachers of English Knowledge and Awareness of Dyslexia: A case study in Primary Iraqi Schools","description":"Dyslexia is a learning disability in which people face difficulty reading though they are intelligent and have motivation for reading. Therefore; it impacts the portion of the brain responsible for processing language. Such a condition compromises the learning efficiency of the affected person, which generally gets unnoticed. Even affected children are unaware of their state. The study investigates the knowledge and awareness of dyslexia among teachers of English in Iraqi primary schools. this study has three objectives: (i) To investigate the amount of awareness and knowledge among the primary school teachers of English in Baghdad City about dyslexia.; (ii) To examine how English teachers\u2019 awareness of dyslexia is affected by their age, gender, grade level, length of service, and academic background; and (iii) To determine whether there is a connection between teachers\u2019 total knowledge score and their knowledge and confidence level rating. An exploratory approach was adopted to collect and analyze the data. This study was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic when very few schools were open and working in online mode with no physical attendance. A total of 34 EFL (English as a foreign language) teachers from governmental and private primary schools in Baghdad \u2013 Iraq, were assigned to the survey through online random sampling. The results pertained to the following characteristics: the participants\u2019 demographic data, exploring teachers\u2019 knowledge and awareness regarding dyslexia, and teachers\u2019 observation of dyslexia. Findings revealed that most teachers have little experience but a considerable grasp of the learning disorder. Inductive training is highly recommended for teachers of English to promote their early knowledge and awareness of dyslexia and to support dyslexic children to overcome their difficulties in learning.","tags":["learning disorder","teacher\u2019s knowledge","Awareness","dyslexia"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:23:39.195182","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.22","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rw5d9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/rw5d9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/rw5d9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rw5d9","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.22","dataset_id":"socarxiv_32"}

{"osf_id":"42j86","title":"Distance Learning in Moroccan Higher Education during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Case of Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University Students","description":"With the spread of Covid-19, several countries, including Morocco, have declared the status of a health emergency. This caused schools to stop giving classes and block the Moroccan educational system. The Ministry of Education resorted to implementing distance education as an alternative to guarantee learning continuity. This includes applying some measures, such as broadcasting classes on TV and encouraging teachers to use online platforms like Microsoft Teams and Zoom. However, the online experience was not an easy task due to a lack of digital training and internet access. In this regard, the present paper aims to investigate the extent to which Moroccan university students are satisfied with the implementation of online learning. It also investigates the main challenges students encounter in their virtual experience. This study is significant as it provides us with a clear understanding of distance learning as a novel experience in Morocco and the challenges that hindered its success. It is also important because it would add to the accumulation of human knowledge. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed through means of questionnaires and interviews, respectively. Questionnaires were administered to students from Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Fes who belong to different departments. As for interviews, they were conducted with the same students to give them the chance to elaborate on their answers.  The findings of the study revealed that the majority of Moroccan university students were not satisfied with their distance learning experience as it was hard for them to interact due to connection issues. The study also showed that most of the students were confused and unmotivated to learn.","tags":["distance learning","Covid-19","digital Skills","information communication technology"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:28:23.693545","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.24","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/42j86\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/42j86\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/42j86","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/42j86","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.24","dataset_id":"socarxiv_34"}

The uppermost aim of this study is to scrutinize the perceptions of translanguaging by undergraduate female students of English literature (drama) as a major. The study\u2019s central  question is how female drama students perceive translanguaging in their English literature classroom. Moreover, The critical  significance of this research paper is how female drama students perceive the use of translanguaging for the first  second language (L2) learning. The results of this study are expected to fill the knowledge gap about how the students perceive the use of  the first language ( L1) in English literature classrooms in Arabs contexts in general and in King Khalid University\u2019s contexts in particular. Female students\u2019 perceptions of drama were scrutinized by using  a Likert-type questionnaire of thirteen items which were assayed quantitatively utilizing descriptive data. The participants of the study were twenty-five female students of drama majoring in English language and pursuing their undergraduate program at King Khalid university. The paramount results of the probe indicated that responses of female students of English drama to the statements in the questionnaire were mixed and echoed both positive and negative about using the first language and the second language in an English literature classroom. Moreover, female students\u2019 perceptions of the application of (L1) in classes of English drama were generally good on the use of both the first language and the second language. The study revealed that the use of the English language is advantageous and can help enhance  English fours skills, English proficiency, and understanding of the drama.Their views are more optimistic about using (L2) than using( L1). Also, they perceived that they would learn more successfully in English drama classes if translanguaging practice was utilized by a professor of English drama which means that the application of translanguaging within English drama classrooms is a practical and sound strategy that benefits female students of drama to boost their English fluency, generate insights, comprehend the content, and delve deeper into the subject matter of English drama.","tags":["Saudi female students of English drama","Translanguaging","perception","Classrooms","King Khalid University"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:35:57.364742","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.26","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zt72g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/zt72g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/zt72g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zt72g","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.26","dataset_id":"socarxiv_36"}

To achieve the study\u2019s aims, the researchers adopt Bhatia\u2019s (1993) framework of cognitive construction supported by van Emeren\u2019s (2010) pragma-dialectic framework. The study demonstrates that both presidents adhere to this genre structuring to further their political agendas. For a positive and promising image, presidents focus on highlighting domestic and international issues to reflect leadership. On the other hand, highlighting controversies and defense strategies appear to be prominent in debate in consensus with the contemplative nature of this genre.

Taking a qualitative perspective, research based on a series of observations and interviews was conducted on Fatima and her caregivers, namely her mother and her two elder siblings. Fatima was primarily diagnosed as having a learning delay, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and hyperactivity but not speech development. This study aims to look at the English language learning difficulties of a child with mild autism who has been diagnosed with no speech development issues. Findings revealed that communicative pragmatic deficits are an obvious limitation displayed by Fatima as she develops in age. Though Fatima exhibits quite proficient use of the English language, she shoulders pragmatic challenges in communication and still has a long way to be communicatively competent as other teenagers her age. In addition, the commitment and support shown by her family members are also key in aiding both her linguistic and social development.  It is believed the findings could add to what is already known about second language learning among children with autism as perspectives from a \u2018home\u2019 as an informal learning institution were observed and analyzed.

The present study examines the impact of social media and internet celebrities on the lifestyle habits of Algerian EFL learners. A lot of studies have been conducted on how social media can be used in EFL learning, yet very little is known about their effects beyond the EFL classroom. The findings of this study could provide insights into how excessive media usage could lead to the cultivation of new habits and lifestyle tendencies among young people. The main questions that guided this study were: to what extent are Algerian EFL learners exposed to social media? To what extent do they interact with internet celebrities? And how are they influenced by internet celebrities? One hundred and eleven students of English at Mostefa Ben Boulaid University, Algeria, were surveyed in this study. The findings suggest that Algerian EFL learners are heavily exposed to social networks due to the usefulness and efficiency of these networks as informal language learning tools. In addition to language learning, EFL learners are very attracted by other online content, such as fashion and cooking, which makes them continuously involved with, and influenced by, social media celebrities. Consequently, this continuous involvement with internet celebrities shapes EFL learners\u2019 lifestyle habits.","tags":["Algerian EFL students","celebrity involvement","parasocial interaction","EFL learning","social media","internet celebrities"],"date":"2023-01-04T02:46:10.431263","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.29","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/z78va\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/z78va\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/z78va","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/z78va","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.29","dataset_id":"socarxiv_39"}

{"osf_id":"fd8yx","title":"Formation of Cross-cultural Competence of Prospective English Teachers","description":"The article substantiates the importance of forming prospective English teachers\u2019 cross-cultural competence. Nowadays, education focuses on cooperation and establishing cross-cultural relations between the representatives of diverse cultural societies. Therefore, it concentrates on forming a personality capable of absorbing and reproducing verbal and non-verbal information during dialogical communication with foreign negotiators. This paper aims to validate the category \u201ccross-cultural competence of a prospective English teacher,\u201d develop its structure and experimentally verify its effectiveness. The study establishes that cross-cultural competence covers linguistic, sociocultural, activity, and axiologically-emotive components. The authors used the following theoretical research methods: analysis of philosophical, lingua didactic literature and scientific studies, synthesis, comparison, concretization; empiric methods: questionnaire-diagnostic (survey, testing, summative assessment, interview); analysis of speech activity products (spoken replies); lecture attendance and analysis; pedagogical experiment; methods of statistical treatment and experimental results analysis. The research on the training peculiarities of future English teachers based on cross-cultural grounds allowed us to conclude that the experimentally-verified methodology is effective. The practical data analysis points out the rise of forming cross-cultural competence levels in the experimental group. The reason is the cultural enrichment of linguistic material and the revelation of contrastive aspects.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-04T03:02:23.716670","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.34","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fd8yx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/fd8yx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/fd8yx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fd8yx","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.34","dataset_id":"socarxiv_44"}
{"osf_id":"ynxr6","title":"TESL Undergraduates\u2019 Perceptions: Utilizing Social Media to Elevate Speaking Skills","description":"Teaching English as a Second Language undergraduates are English teachers in training. Recently, a concern arose when it was found that these undergraduates in Indonesia perceived their speaking skills as the lowest in terms of their mastery. Many studies have been conducted on the use of social media. Still, there is a literature gap in using social media among TESL undergraduates in the Malaysian context. Thus, this study aimed to explore TESL undergraduates\u2019 perceptions of their speaking skill mastery and their perceptions of utilizing social media to enhance their speaking skills. It was significant to investigate how those undergraduates feel about their speaking skill mastery to create self-awareness. By being aware of their belief, they can find ways to keep improving themselves. The main question for the study was to discover respondents\u2019 belief in their speaking mastery level and respondents\u2019 self-confidence in speaking performance. A total of 132 respondents from the National University of Malaysia participated in this research through an online questionnaire conducted on Google Forms. The results showed that the students recorded unsatisfactory perceptions of their speaking skill mastery. The data revealed that social media does help in elevating their speaking skills. The students chose \u2018WhatsApp,\u2019 \u2018YouTube,\u2019 and \u2018TikTok\u2019 as their preferred social media that help their oral communication skills. In addition, limitations and recommendations were explained to better future works in the equivalent or relevant studies.","tags":["English speaking skills","TESL undergraduate","social media","ESL student","speaking skills"],"date":"2023-01-04T03:06:59.159238","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.35","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ynxr6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ynxr6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ynxr6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ynxr6","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.35","dataset_id":"socarxiv_45"}

It contributes to the ongoing discussions on terminology standardization in the Arab world as well as sheds light on translation practices in technology-related fields. More specifically, it seeks to address the interrelationship between current standardization efforts and the use of glossing in Saudi Arabia. In doing so, the paper hopes to answer one main question: How does standardization of technical terminology affects the use of glossing in Saudi technology blogs? A large corpus of 203 texts (mainly reviews of computer-related products) was compiled using two corpus tools (i.e., Wordsmith and Sketch Engine). The texts were divided into two sets, based on the writing style and type of the platform. Then, the electronically retrieved term frequency lists were checked against the Saudi Terminology Data Bank (BASM), a four-language database of standardized technological terms, to determine whether native Arabic equivalents for the glossed terms existed. Three significant trends were identified: 1) bloggers, across the two sets, rarely gloss terms with firmly established Arabic equivalents, 2) informal bloggers used more glossing for terms with standardized\u2014but not commonly used\u2014Arabic forms or opted for non-standardized terms, and 3) glossing yielded high frequencies, across the two sets, for abbreviations exceeding two letters, plus a marked variation in Arabic term use. The marked differences between the two groups were attributed to a variety of factors, including a lagging standardization effort by official bodies","tags":["translation","technology","Saudi technology blogs","standardization","terminology","Corpus-based study","glossing"],"date":"2023-01-04T03:10:03.087468","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.36","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/za3d4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/za3d4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/za3d4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/za3d4","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.36","dataset_id":"socarxiv_46"}

In the dynamic process of teacher identity formation, EFL teachers are likely to experience anxiety in role shifts. This article studies the interactions between the internal and external perceptions of Chinese English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers\u2019 role through a comparative analysis of teacher metaphors. Metaphors written by EFL teachers represent pro-internal perceptions, and those extracted from research articles stand for pro-external perceptions. Within China\u2019s socio-cultural context, the study aims to demonstrate the consistency and discrepancy between the internal and external perceptions of the EFL teacher\u2019s role. Two groups of metaphors were first compared based on the conceptual themes and then categorized into four types: Learner-oriented, Social Order, Social Reform, and Cultural Transmission according to the metaphor-categorization framework. The consistency and discrepancy in teacher perception revealed by comparing two groups of teacher metaphors shed light on the possible reasons for Chinese EFL teachers\u2019 role anxiety in identity formation.","tags":["comparative analysis","role anxiety","teacher metaphor","teacher identity","Chinese EFL teachers"],"date":"2023-01-04T03:12:52.119883","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.3","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q4frp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/q4frp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/q4frp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q4frp","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/vol13no4.3","dataset_id":"socarxiv_47"}

The relevance of digital devices and associated indicators are used as proxies to measure the development of societies today. In that context, both top-down and\/or bottom-up technology in education initiatives seek to promote different forms of incorporating digital technologies in educational contexts. There are many successful experiences around the world to implement digital technologies in school contexts. However, it is critical to analyze the mismatch between the expectations and the reality but also to enquire how to provide better evidence and analysis to deepen and expand the knowledge in the field of education and technology from the Top-Down and Bottom-Up initiatives. Keeping that in mind, an international call for papers was launched that finally 14 contributions from 12 countries were included in this special issue. The articles shed light about two important aspects: (1) how good technical solutions cannot ignore the context in which these digital technologies are being used or adopted. (2) how the access to technologies can simply amplify the existing inequalities within a society (as well as between different societies) if additional (in most cases non-technical) components are not being carefully considered.","tags":["digital technologies","digital policies","top-down initiatives","Digital learning","EDTECH","digital learning"],"date":"2023-01-05T00:57:33.026687","doi":null,"subjects":["Secondary Education","Online and Distance Education","Education","International and Comparative Education","Higher Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cnrf6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/cnrf6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/cnrf6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cnrf6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_50"}
{"osf_id":"vw9zs","title":"Perceived Motives of Public Diplomacy Influence Foreign Public Opinion","description":"Although many countries engage in public diplomacy, we know relatively little about the conditions under which their efforts create foreign support for their desired policy outcomes. Drawing on the psychological theory of \"insincerity aversion,\" we argue that the positive effects of public diplomacy on foreign public opinion are attenuated and potentially even eliminated when foreign citizens become suspicious about possible hidden motives. To test this theory, we fielded a survey experiment involving divergent media frames of a real Russian medical donation to the U.S. early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that an adapted news article excerpt describing Russia's donation as genuine can decrease American citizens' support for sanctions on Russia. However, exposing respondents to information suggesting that Russia had political motivations for their donation is enough to cancel out the positive effect.

We used the Mediacloud database to search the names of scientists with different precautionary views (i.e.: signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration and of the John Snow Memorandum) and analyze the frequency with which they are mentioned in newspapers with different political orientation.\nResults. Scientists with more precautionary positions are more likely to be mentioned in left-leaning newspapers, whereas those with less precautionary views on right-leaning ones.

The present study analysed the relation between socioemotional competencies (SECs), student engagement (SE) and psychological distress in youth to understand how they changed over time during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify correlation patterns across time. A three-wave (2019-2021) prospective study was developed using data collected during two COVID-19 lockdowns with 50 youth students. Data were analysed using a cross-lagged model. Overall, participants reported good SECs, SE, and low distress levels. In 2020, SECs were predicted by previous SECs levels and SE. Conversely, SECs in 2020 predicted SE and mental health in 2021. Also, SE in 2020 predicted psychological distress in 2021. In the face of unprecedented stress, SE seems to protect SECs, though online learning seems to have disturbed its positive impact.

Prior research has offered two perspectives that have heretofore been conceptually disconnected: One focuses on personal values, while another emphasizes perceptions of the cultural code. We develop a theoretical account that integrates these approaches by linking them to distinct mechanisms and behavioral consequences of cultural fit. We propose that value congruence\u2014the match between one's values and those that prevail in an organization\u2014relates to the mechanism of group attachment and shapes behavior when one periodically steps back from day-to-day interactions, assesses one's identification with an organization, and determines whether to stay or voluntarily depart. In contrast, we argue that perceptual congruence\u2014the degree to which one implicitly understands an organization\u2019s prevailing values and norms\u2014relates to the mechanism of interpersonal coordination and influences behavior when one engages in routine peer interactions. Accordingly, we theorize that these two forms of cultural fit relate to distinct behaviors, voluntary exit and linguistic conformity with peers, respectively. Drawing on email and survey data from a mid-sized technology firm, we find support for our theory and discuss implications of our findings for research on person-culture fit, dual-process models of culture and cognition, and the pairing of surveys with digital trace data.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-07T18:52:12.060303","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychology","Sociology","Social Psychology","Organizations, Occupations, and Work","Culture","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9j5qf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/9j5qf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/9j5qf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9j5qf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_62"}

It draws insights from the changing socio-cultural diversity management landscape across the UK National Health Service (NHS) provider organisations, pinning down what NHS employees think and what managers are doing. The NHS embodies the shared commitment of the government and people in the UK to provide healthcare and other health-related support for those in need regardless of socio-demographic, economic and cultural differences. Yet detailed empirical analysis accounting for recent progress in creating an inclusive NHS work environment - where employees can readily participate in organisational decision-making and achieve their full potential - are sorely lacking. Similarly, it is unclear whether NHS diversity management practices and cultures support or counter workplace inequality, harassment, victimisation and discrimination. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaire surveys, email correspondences and phone interviews. Desk review enabled assessment of official NHS diversity policies and standards to ascertain their relevance in relation to the requirements espoused in the Public Sector Equality Duty of the UK Equality Act of 2010. Diversity management practices in the NHS cover (i) staff recruitment (ii) staff support, training, development and networking, (iii) staff performance rating and rewards, (iv) diversity auditing, and (v) support for work-life balance\/flexible working. Results show that policies and standards expected to anchor NHS diversity management cultures do not always translate to beneficial management of employee diversity on the ground. Practical guidance on ways to monitor and evaluate diversity management practices is lacking. A diverse NHS workforce provides valuable skillsets, talents and abilities, but without effective monitoring and evaluation of diversity management practices, workplace discrimination could undermine employee cohesion and stifle organisational effectiveness over the long term. The paper advances an empirical case to buttress the importance of linking employee groups to equality and diversity heroes as a way to foster staff diversity management in multicultural hospital workplaces.","tags":["Diversity dimension","Race","Discrimination","Minority ethnic group","Equality","Positive actions","Black lives"],"date":"2023-01-07T22:28:54.674552","doi":null,"subjects":["Organization Development","Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ag6hy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ag6hy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ag6hy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ag6hy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_63"}

Measures to prevent and counter it often crosscut multiple intervention areas and practices. However, enquiries into existing gaps and opportunities in preventing and countering violent extremism (P\/CVE) in regions experiencing multiple forms of violence have so far been preliminary, with scant context-specific evidence to inform better preventative strategies. Here, we assemble and analyse diverse data bothering on VE and P\/CVE issues in northwest Nigeria generated through a combination of multiple methods: desk reviews, scoping visit, telephone interviews, young citizens panels, expert workshop and consensus conference. Our data cover issues around local support for violent extremist groups, people\u2019s motivation for joining VE activities, spread and level of risks of recruitment and radicalisation, collaborative strengths of organisations working on P\/CVE issues, and local prevention, intervention and response efforts. We find that ideological support for VE groups exists, mirroring the prevalence of shared religious beliefs, ethnic nationalism and political philosophy between affected communities and VE groups. Policies and practices empowering people to build alliances against radical ideologies from within specific ideological communities are severely lacking. These \u2013 in combination with VE root causes and motivations - heighten the risks of radicalisation and recruitment. Moreover, two-thirds of current P\/CVE policies address VE as a security challenge as against confronting it as a social issue, demonstrating the primacy of militarised responses over \u2018soft power\u2019 measures. In addition, affected communities view defence and intelligence measures as exclusionary and less sensitive to human rights protection and local needs for citizens empowerment and community resilience. Our findings mirror gaps in P\/CVE efforts in fragile settings, highlighting ways in which P\/CVE opportunities around participation, prevention and protection can be maximised to close critical intervention gaps.","tags":["community resilience","consensus conference","citizen protection","ideological support","northwest Nigeria","violent extremism"],"date":"2023-01-07T23:37:53.094703","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Peace and Conflict","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Terrorism Studies","Political Science","Defense and Security Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j5u8p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/j5u8p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/j5u8p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j5u8p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_64"}

Political leaders, policy makers, planners and designers are developing guidelines to minimize and insulate from the spread of disease and improve urban public health permanently. However, some ideas for sustainable post-pandemic planning and development have already become apparent. For example, urban centers must facilitate the safe and efficient movement of essential workers and residents using real time information. Cities should also provide open and safe spaces for the residents to gather for recreation, de-stressing and as the means of reducing the urban densities. Planners are contemplating developing an effective transportation network that could be more efficient, sanitary and effective to keep urban areas safe if similar pandemics emerge in the future. Planners also are engaged in designing housing to promote public health that helps reduce the transmission of communicable diseases.","tags":["Sustainability","Self-reliance","Public Health","Covid-19","Planning","Nepal","Urban"],"date":"2023-01-08T02:48:56.383613","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Urban Studies and Planning","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Urban Studies","Environmental Policy","Public Affairs"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zf2k3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/zf2k3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/zf2k3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zf2k3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_65"}

Our study aims to fill this gap with a quantitative and qualitative study of Weibo's community-driven content moderation system with policy documents and eleven million public moderation cases and decision data from 2012 to 2021. Based on the reporting activities, platform decisions, and jury actions, we investigated the motivations and behavior patterns of three important actors in this governance model: reporting users, platform authority, and user jurors. We suggest that users who frequently reported content and initiated the community-driven content moderation process, usually have a pattern of voluntarily policing the community or abusing others, sometimes coordinately, and were also treated differently by the platform. We indicate that Weibo's strategical moderation decisions have significantly distinctive preferences over cases from different categories or with different harmfulness levels, and the cases involving socially sensitive issues were given more consideration and penalized more severely than common misbehavior. We explore how Weibo authority leveraged the usually one-sided votes of digital jurors to endorse its final decisions while the reason notes given by crowdsourced jurors also revealed a serious issue of decaying motivation. Our findings offer important insights into understanding the coordination between a social media platform and voluntary users to moderate an online community, and resonate with the question of how an autonomic platform governance model can prevail or perish.","tags":["Social Media","Platform Governance","Content Moderation","Weibo","Digital Jury"],"date":"2023-01-08T14:51:26.338344","doi":null,"subjects":["Science and Technology Studies","Social Media","Communication","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Influence and Political Communication"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/da8fz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/da8fz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/da8fz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/da8fz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_66"}

The reform was similar to a reform that had entered into force in Denmark in 1969. A re-regulation of pornography was carried out during the period 1973-1999. The result of this study shows that although child pornography in print and sexual intercourse in public were criminalised during the rule of conservative Governments (1976-1982), it was not until 1990 that all political parties took a firm stand against child pornography in moving images.

As coordinated practice in time and space is dynamic and ever-changing, memorizing explicit rules and following them may not only be unnecessary but also insufficient to guarantee \u201cmoral\u201d behavior. An unskilled novice who knows and follows explicit rules may nonetheless disrupt other practitioners for lack of skill. Instead, a moral person is someone who responds \u201cappropriately\u201d to the continuously evolving situational dynamics. This grounds the sense of oughtness in the smoothness of dynamic, situated practices and thus is the result of skill development and use. The morality of mundane and taken-for-granted acts of ongoing coordination is typically revealed when practices are disrupted. We describe two generic kinds of disruption, (1) procedural and (2) conceptual. The first entails an undesirable interference with or coercion of procedural ability. The second entails witnessing an action that violates one\u2019s conceptual understanding of how the practice \u201cought to be.\u201d As a result of the constant ebb and flow of people with varying degrees of enskilment and with varying experiences in slightly different local ecologies, disruptions are bound to occur.

Nonetheless, theories exploring connections to specific outcomes are lacking, and this gap is especially striking regarding the vaunted connections between sport and social cohesion. Sport has been prominently positioned as a vehicle to promote social cohesion, yet the connections between sport and social cohesion have not been explored in a robust fashion. Literature and programmes have been criticised for failing to define social cohesion, and there remains a lack of knowledge concerning practices, activities, and mechanisms within programmes. As such, we neither have a clear picture of the goals being addressed nor the mechanisms supporting those goals. The following paper seeks to address these gaps by presenting a conceptual framework connecting common practices within programmes with existing theories and specific social cohesion outcomes. To do so, findings from extensive previous work in Europe are contextualised against existing theories. In turn, this generates a better understanding of the mechanisms in sport for social cohesion, provides guidance to implementers, and identifies areas for future development.","tags":["sport for development","social capital","intergroup contact","europe","empowerment","experiential learning","social cohesion"],"date":"2023-01-09T13:53:09.820548","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Sports Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/um69c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/um69c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/um69c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/um69c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_71"}

These dynamics laid the groundwork for a global, interdisciplinary dialogue of -and for- political creation.\nFast forward to the present and the early discussions on peer-to-peer technologies seem already outworn; mere chapters in the history of an infrastructure whose public nature and legacy are reflected only on a fraction of what people perceive as the \u2018Internet\u2019. Legal battles that marked the development of entire disciplines are now -almost- irrelevant serving as good reminders that power lies more in avoiding battles (ie ad-targeting) than it does in winning them. Today, programmable networks, computational infrastructures, and the software applications they support have constructed a \u2018private Internet\u2019 whose rules and trajectories are largely shaped by actors accountable only to their shareholders. Actively supported by state authorities, tech conglomerates do not only \u2018take power\u2019 by capturing public-sector space but they \u2018make power\u2019 by constantly experimenting with novel technological possibilities. Responding to some of these challenges, policymakers have been focusing on ways to regulate data and -more recently- on instituting, top-down, modes of data governance. But although data is power, power is not only data and (as ongoing work on programmable infrastructures indicates) power over what can be computed, creates power over what can be decided. Therefore, the agenda on the regulation of private power over data requires a parallel enquiry on the power concentration in the world\u2019s computational resources and the value chains they sustain and support.  \nThis paper is part of such a project. By reviewing early work of network theorists and Internet scholars as well as literature on the governance of commons, this paper argues that beyond market, states, and their hybrids and beyond private property and public sector regimes, there exists political space for social practices and transformative legal interventions that can give shape to radically different institutional actions for the management of the world\u2019s infocomputational resources. Programmable commons and the public value of programmability are thus introduced as parts of a broader political project that aspires to democratise access to, and management of these resources.

The competitiveness of European Union businesses is presently seen as critically dependent on expansion of next-generation communication technologies. Yet, EU telcos are displaying returns on capital that disappoint private investors, leading in some cases to depressed share prices, and potentially making them vulnerable to takeovers bids by financial investors. Given their essential role, the prospect of EU telcos falling into mostly foreign-owned, fiercely profit-maximizing, and\/or cost-cutting investors is unappealing for policy makers, at both the national and the European level. One solution suggested by the telcos themselves is that they be allowed to consolidate. \nEconomic theory does not provide a clear answer to how such concentration might affect investment in infrastructure. In this paper, we provide a comparative empirical analysis of the relationship between market concentration and investment in infrastructure in the telco sector. First, we compare investment rates in infrastructure by major telco companies in both the EU and the more concentrated US market. We find more value being returned to customers in the form of infrastructure investment in the less-concentrated EU market. Second, we compare telcos' profitability with that of other corporations involved in the information or ``eye-ball'' value chain. We find operating profits of telcos on both sides of the Atlantic are broadly in line with other companies of the value chain, with the notable exception of the highly concentrated digital ad exchange business. This evidence suggests that lack of incentives rather than lack of ability explains the larger portion of profits invested into infrastructure in the EU compared to the US.  Rather than allowing market concentration, which could raise consumer prices and lower infrastructure investment incentives, EU regulators might consider other fund-raising mechanisms, such as redistributing profits from digital ad exchanges.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-10T09:34:16.784521","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Science and Technology Policy","Economic Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economic Policy","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m42uh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/m42uh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/m42uh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m42uh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_75"}

II Logicism and Hilbert mathematics,  the identification of logic and set theory, and G\u00f6del\u2019s \u201ccompleteness paper\u201d (1930)","description":"The previous Part I of the paper (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.33774\/coe-2022-wlr02) discusses the option of the G\u00f6del incompleteness statement (1931: whether \u201cSatz VI\u201d or \u201cSatz X\u201d) to be an axiom due to the pair of the axiom of induction in arithmetic and the axiom of infinity in set theory after interpreting them as logical negations to each other. The present Part II considers the previous G\u00f6del\u2019s paper (1930) (and more precisely, the negation of \u201cSatz VII\u201d, or \u201cthe completeness theorem\u201d) as a necessary condition for granting the G\u00f6del incompleteness statement to be a theorem just as the statement itself, to be an axiom. Then, the \u201ccompleteness paper\u201d can be interpreted as relevant to Hilbert mathematics, according to which mathematics and reality as well as arithmetic and set theory are rather entangled or complementary rather than mathematics to obey reality able only to create models of the latter. According to that, both papers (1930; 1931) can be seen as advocating Russell\u2019s logicism or the intensional propositional logic versus both extensional arithmetic and set theory. Reconstructing history of philosophy, Aristotle\u2019s logic and doctrine can be opposed to those of Plato or the pre-Socratic schools as establishing ontology or intensionality versus extensionality. Husserl\u2019s phenomenology can be analogically realized including and particularly as philosophy of mathematics. One can identify propositional logic and set theory by virtue of G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem (1930: \u201cSatz VII\u201d) and even both and arithmetic in the sense of the \u201ccompactness theorem\u201d (1930: \u201cSatz X\u201d) therefore opposing the latter to the \u201cincompleteness paper\u201d (1931). An approach identifying homomorphically propositional logic and set theory as the same structure of Boolean algebra, and arithmetic as the \u201chalf\u201d of it in a rigorous construction involving information and its unit of a bit. Propositional logic and set theory are correspondingly identified as the shared zero-order logic of the class of all first-order logics and the class at issue correspondingly. Then, quantum mechanics does not need any quantum logics, but only the relation of propositional logic, set theory, arithmetic, and information: rather a change of the attitude into more mathematical, philosophical, and speculative than physical, empirical and experimental. Hilbert\u2019s epsilon calculus can be situated in the same framework of the relation of propositional logic and the class of all mathematical theories. The horizon of Part III investigating Hilbert mathematics (i.e. according to the Pythagorean viewpoint about the world as mathematical) versus G\u00f6del mathematics (i.e. the usual understanding of mathematics as all mathematical models of the world external to it) is outlined.","tags":["epsilon calculus","quantum logic","Husserl","Russell","ontology","set theory","bit of information","propositional logic","G\u00f6del","Aristotle","Pythagoreanism","Boolean algebra","arithmetic","first-order logic","logicism"],"date":"2023-01-10T11:36:59.965523","doi":null,"subjects":["Philosophy","Arts and Humanities","Logic and Foundations of Mathematics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/57rxf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/57rxf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/57rxf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/57rxf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_76"}

We found that there is little evidence that Open Research products, namely Open Access and open data, which aim at increasing access and transparency, are useful in integrating science into policy-making.

Our revised approach problematizes the conflation of epistemic uncertainty with phenomenological uncertainty while providing sound footing for a key sociological insight: that reliance on the routine social order is both the cognitive default and based on substantial practical evidence. We develop two broad suggestions for future research from these implications: (1) sociological research should examine the role of intuitive faith\u2014as opposed to deliberate trust\u2014in late modern societies, and (2) analysts should challenge the role of deliberate trust as the \u201cmodal\u201d form of reliance in contemporary research.","tags":["faith","dual-process","trust","cognition","reliance"],"date":"2023-01-10T17:52:17.166663","doi":"10.1111\/jtsb.12160","subjects":["Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9kpmz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/9kpmz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/9kpmz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9kpmz","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/jtsb.12160","dataset_id":"socarxiv_78"}

The Impact of Social Distancing Preferences, Behavior, and  Emotional Costs on Subjective Wellbeing During the Epidemic","description":"Purpose:  To inhibit the spread of  COVID-19 Public health officials stress, and governments often require,  restrictions on social interaction (\"social distancing\"). While the medical benefits are clear, important questions remain about these measures' downsides: How bitter is this medicine? \nData:  Ten large non-probability internet-based surveys between April and November 2020, weighted statistically to reflect the US population in age, education, and religious background and excluding respondents who even occasionally role-played rather than giving their own true views; N=6,223. Pre-epidemic data from 2017-2019, N= 4,032.\nMeasurement:  Reliable multiple-item scales including subjective wellbeing (2 European Quality of Life Survey items, Cronbach's alpha=.85); distancing attitudes (5 items, alpha=.87); distancing behavior e.g. standing 6' apart in public (5 items, alpha=.80);  emotional cost of distancing and restrictions on social interaction (8-12 items, alpha=.94); and an extensive suite of controls (19 variables).\nMethods:  Descriptive statistics, OLS regression, structural equation models.  \nResults:  Subjective wellbeing is greater for those who approve of distancing, for those who practice distancing,  and particularly for those whose distancing attitudes and behavior are congruent, either both in favor or both opposed (multiplicative interaction). The emotional cost of distancing is strongly tied to wellbeing and is heterogeneous, with some disliking distancing much more than others. An SEM model suggests causality: that emotional costs strongly reduce wellbeing but not vice-versa.  During the epidemic, COVID issues constitute two of the top 5 influences on wellbeing, behind only subjective health and religious belief and tied with income.

A Multi-Informant Mixed-Methods Study on Discipline Strategies","description":"In Portugal in 2021, 85% of children placed in out-of-home care were in non-specialized residential care. Evidence on discipline strategies used in these childcare contexts is scarce. This study aims at analyzing the discipline strategies used by caregivers in residential care based on multiple informants\u2019 reports - children\/adolescents in care, caregivers, and directors. It follows a theoretical framework that includes and relates the concept of quality in residential care, positive discipline, and the child's rights. A total of 424 children\/adolescents, 266 caregivers and 60 directors in 60 residential care centers participated in this study. Data on discipline strategies were collected by interviewing all the participants and analyzed by resorting to a mixed methodology. A content analysis allowed for the identification of 33 subcategories, organized into six categories, which were computed into three major types of discipline strategies: Positive and Induction-Based Strategies, Punitive Strategies, and Strategies that Violate the Child\u2019s Rights. Findings showed a frequent use of punitive discipline strategies that violate the child's rights. Additionally, a cluster analysis based on the reports of the three informants allowed for the identification of three groups of residential care centers that used different discipline strategies - Punitive Centers, Inductive Centers, and Rights-Violating Centers. Findings showed that Punitive Centers tend to be gender-mixed and Rights-Violating Centers tend to be gender-segregated. This study also revealed the frequent use of punitive discipline strategies that violate the child's rights in residential care, requiring the need to provide qualified training to caregivers on appropriate discipline strategies.","tags":["child's rights","mixed-methods","positive discipline","discipline strategies","multi-informants","residential care","institutionalized children"],"date":"2023-01-11T00:09:30.191269","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Psychology","Child Psychology","Social Work","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/drfna\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/drfna\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/drfna","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/drfna","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_81"}

This AI technique has been used to combine, replace or superimpose images and videos to create controversial deepfakes videos. The emergence of deepfakes has been referred to as infopocalypse due to the difficulty the content poses to producers, publishers, and consumers of information. Recent studies in Europe, China, and the United States have reported a rise in user cynicism, apprehension, and erosion of journalists' roles. However, literature is lacking on African online media discourses on deepfakes technology and content. Using mediatization theory and reflexive inductive thematic analysis, this study sought to fill this gap by investigating socio-political discourses, perceptions, and awareness of deepfakes technology and media content in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. Findings indicate that, unlike the rest of the world, online media is concerned about deepfakes impact on already fragile political and security situations, particularly during the electioneering period. There are deep anxieties about the rising cases of deepfakes-instigated financial fraud, religious animosity, xenophobic attacks, and cyber-harassment. Also, even though there is a genuine effort to enumerate deepfakes usefulness through media\/legal\/public literacy and awareness, the general online media logic and perception are dystopian.

However, turnover among second-generation immigrants may be less affected by workplace immigrant composition due to intergenerational assimilation and weakened ethnic boundaries. We show that immigrants\u2019 likelihood of workplace exit declines when the share of immigrant-background coworkers increase and this effect is solely driven by exposure to contact among coworkers in same-skill occupations. This pattern is similar among members of the second generation. We also find the immigrants\u2019 likelihood of workplace exit is reduced when they work for an immigrant-background top manager.

A main driver of such transformations is disputes over framing the movements\u2019 purpose, which arise due to the entrance of new micro-cohorts of activists with different views than those of the veteran cohorts. This paper provides unique in-sight into the rarely studied process of such frame disputes by studying the entrance in-to the refugee solidarity movement of a new micro-cohort of activists mobilized in re-sponse to the 2022 war in Ukraine. While united in the endeavor to assist the victims of the war in Ukraine, veteran activists and newcomer activists strongly disagree on whether other groups of refugees should be entitled to the same relatively high level of help offered to the Ukrainian refugees. Online ethnography of movement activity on the social media of Facebook allows us to access the framing disputes as they unfold. While major ideological differences exist between the veteran and newcomer cohorts, frame disputes are rare. Rather than the expected clash between cohorts, we find that the contentious and humanitarian practices were compartmentalized into different Facebook fora.","tags":["Refugee Solidarity Movement","Deservingess","Ukraine War","Micro-cohorts","Syrian Refugees","Collective identity","Frame disputes"],"date":"2023-01-11T10:14:03.841905","doi":null,"subjects":["Collective Behavior and Social Movements","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vg2r5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/vg2r5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/vg2r5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vg2r5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_85"}

However, this work often assumes heterosexuality and overlooks sexual minorities despite growing scholarly interest in union formation and dissolution outcomes among lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. We investigate whether and how the gender gap in re-partnering intersects with sexual identity to highlight the role of gender relations as a social force that shapes union formation outcomes, namely, forming a new union after the dissolution of another. We use retrospective data on cohabitation and marriage histories from the British Understanding Society survey (UKHLS) to estimate event history models and find that lesbian women are more likely to re-partner than gay men, but no evidence for a gender gap among bisexuals. The results are robust when accounting for possible compositional differences between the groups using exact matching techniques. These findings suggest that the persistent gender gap found in past studies is not as universal as previously presumed and that sexuality plays a vital role in re-partnering outcomes. Therefore, family demographers should re-consider existing models and theories that explain the gender re-partnering gap to incorporate the context of these partnerships, namely, their gender relational context.","tags":["Re-partnering","Gender","Sexual minorities","Union Formation"],"date":"2023-01-11T10:49:40.692918","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Family"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/w8xbu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/w8xbu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/w8xbu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/w8xbu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_86"}

By calculating the cumulative residual between modelled\/forecasted trend and observed fertility rates, we can calculate fertility deficit and recuperation.\n\nBy December 2021, Spain had only seen a partial recuperation of the fertility relative to expected trend with large heterogeneity.

{"osf_id":"uw4nq","title":"Ground-Truthing in the European Health Data Space","description":"In this position paper I discuss the use of health-related training data for medical research, in light of the European Health Data Space. If such data is deployed as a proxy for 'the truth on the ground', we need to address the issue of proxies. Ground truth in machine learning is the pragmatic stand-in or proxy for whatever is considered to be the case or should be the case. Developing a ground truth dataset requires curation, i.e. a number of translations, constructions and cleansing. What if the resulting proxies misrepresent what they stand for and what if the imposed interoperability of health data across the EU affects the quality of the data and\/or their relationship to what they stand for? I argue that ground-truthing is an act rather than a given, that this act is key to machine learning and assert that this act can have potentially fatal implications for the reliability of the output. Deciding on the ground truth is what philosophers may call a speech act with performative effects. Emphasising these effects will allow us to better address the constructive nature of the datasets used in medical informatics and should help the EU legislature to take a precautionary approach to medical informatics.","tags":["health data","interactive Machine Learning","law","Proxy","European Health Data Space","Ground Truth","large language models","AlphaFold","EHDS"],"date":"2023-01-12T08:12:33.776524","doi":null,"subjects":["Law","Health Law and Policy","Computer Law"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/uw4nq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/uw4nq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/uw4nq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/uw4nq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_90"}

Furthermore, the number of acquaintances (or \u201cdegree\u201d) is used for estimating other societal features, such as the size of hard-to-count subpopulations or social cohesion. To estimate the degree, the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) asks survey respondents about the number of people they know with a set of first names for which name statistics are available. For this method to be precise, a set of names needs to be selected for the survey that jointly represent the population on a smaller scale in terms of relevant traits such as gender or age. Finding the optimal set of names is a combinatorial problem for which this paper provides a solution approach. The approach can serve other NSUM users, and can be applied to any population for which name statistics distributed over different categories are available. We empirically show that our approach successfully provides subsets of names replicating the population distribution for six countries with very different name statistics.","tags":["acquaintanceship volume","combinatorial optimization","Network Scale-Up Method","social networks"],"date":"2023-01-12T09:59:11.280778","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Methodology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/t6pk2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/t6pk2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/t6pk2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/t6pk2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_91"}

Issues stemming from the black market, such as the production of counterfeit drugs, the illicit organ trade, lack of physician accessibility, and data security breaches have plagued the medical industry for decades. The black market often takes advantage of both patients and suppliers by playing into their respective needs for health and monetary funds, creating a potent scheme that disrupts the well-being of those in the healthcare industry. This manuscript provides various perspectives and suggestions for nation-state policies that stem from humanitarian resolve and modern medicine. Solutions include reducing medical product sanctions, increasing black market patrol, utilizing nanotechnology and 3D printing to reduce pharmaceutical prices, and adapting virtual clinical trials in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. By virtue of these proposed solutions, international governments and the global healthcare industry can better tackle issues regarding black market influence in medicine and humanitarian aid.","tags":["nanotechnology","COVID-19","black markets","modern medicine","healthcare","sanctions"],"date":"2023-01-12T12:59:48.051844","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6n7y9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/6n7y9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/6n7y9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6n7y9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_92"}

We conducted 52 semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of adults over age 65 or adults with disabilities and analyzed the data through an inductive thematic analysis. Caregivers perceive the largest COVID-19-related caregiving changes to be limited social and physical contacts, changed caregiving tasks, reduced services and supports, and a new focus on vigilance and safety.

This study investigates how to design a bot to effectively and responsibly mobilize people for collective action against corruption. In a large (n=1,331) pre-registered choice-based conjoint survey, we test six message design features: type of injustice, degree of injustice, anger, political partisanship, gender, and efficacy cues. Our results show that calling out cases of severe corruption mobilized people against corruption effectively. We find no empirical support for in-group favoritism based on political affiliation and gender. Yet, some commonly used design features can have contrasting effects on different audiences.

Our findings hence support current moves to reform research assessment.

However, there is still scarce and only indirect evidence on whether neighborhood effects vary by children\u2019s academic proneness. In this paper, we combine the Neighborhood Choice Model with quantile regressions to investigate whether neighborhood effects vary by children\u2019s achievement level. Using Norwegian register data, we demonstrate heterogeneity in the effects of neighborhood deprivation as a function of students\u2019 proneness to academic achievement. Students at the very lowest and highest levels of academic achievement are the least affected by neighborhood disadvantage, while those with achievement below average\u2014but not at the lowest end\u2014are most strongly affected. Moreover, while girls are less affected than boys, and children from less educated and affluent families are more affected by neighborhood disadvantage than their more privileged peers, the effects of these observed moderators are considerably smaller than the heterogeneity observed as a function of academic proneness. Overall, our use of quantile regressions opens up new venues for understanding \u201cfor whom\u201d neighborhoods matter, with individual-level academic vulnerability and strengths being an influential source of neighborhood effects variation.","tags":["Residualized Quantile Regression Model","Academic proneness","Effect heterogeneity","Quantile regressions","Neighborhood disadvantage","Neighborhood Choice Model","Neighborhood effects"],"date":"2023-01-13T13:06:36.073731","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x2hym\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/x2hym\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/x2hym","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x2hym","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_99"}

However, these studies predominantly focus on the early years of schooling and primarily consider achievement outcomes, with little known about the effects in later years of school, and other outcomes. I apply a differential exposure approach to address the role of schooling for both students\u2019 reading achievement and conscientiousness. I use test scores from a biennial mandatory reading test conducted in all Danish public schools (grades 2\u20138), as well as a self-reported survey measure of conscientiousness from an annual mandatory school survey (grades 0\u20138) combined with Danish administrative register data. The results show that school exposure improves student achievement, yet it also leads to a decline in students\u2019 self-reported conscientiousness. I find that schooling contributes to narrowing the gap in reading achievement in second grade, and the results indicate that schooling also reduces the gap in conscientiousness in all grades beyond grade 0. However, these reductions are relatively modest in comparison to the overall differences observed in these outcomes.","tags":["Achievement inequality","Denmark","Achievement gap","Non-cognitive skills","conscientiousness","School effects","Social inequality"],"date":"2023-01-13T14:07:49.336908","doi":null,"subjects":["Secondary Education","Sociology","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility","Early Childhood Education","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research","Sociology of Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ey25m\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ey25m\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ey25m","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ey25m","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_100"}

The objective of this study is to fill in this gap by studying how the propensity to engage in protective behaviours in Europe was shaped by the interplay of individual characteristics and national policies. \nDESIGN: Data on individual behaviour in 27 countries came from the \u201cCorona Survey\u201d module of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, collected in summer 2020. As outcomes, we considered avoidant behaviours (never leaving home, reducing frequency of walks, reducing frequency of social meetings) and preventive behaviour (wearing a face mask). Among relevant policies we considered stay-at-home restrictions, mask wearing policies, and gatherings\u2019 restrictions. Individual characteristics comprised gender, health risk of COVID-19 (older age and poor health), and activity (employment and providing help to other households).\nPARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative samples of older adults (50 years and over); N=51,540 respondents (58% of women).\nRESULTS: Active people (employed and helping other households) were more likely to wear face masks, but less likely to use avoidant behaviours. People at health risk (older people and those in poor health) were more likely to use all types of protective behaviours. Protective behaviours were also more frequent among women than among men. Longer duration of distancing polices correlated with more frequent protective behaviours. Distancing policies reduced social differences in the rate of protective behaviours only in case of social meetings and mask wearing.\nCONCLUSIONS: Protective behaviours responded to distancing policies, but our results suggest that people used them voluntarily, especially if they were at health risk.","tags":["COVID-19","avoidant behaviours","mask wearing","distancing policies","preventive behaviours","older adults"],"date":"2023-01-13T14:41:26.615928","doi":null,"subjects":["Medical Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/md5nq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/md5nq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/md5nq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/md5nq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_101"}

This research note shows that transition periods after rebels gain territorial control are remarkably violent for civilians. Speaking to the civilian victimization and rebel governance literature, we investigate the immediate time period after rebels successfully capture and hold territory. We argue that rebels use violence to gain compliance in newly captured territories until they are able to build up local capacities and institutions for peaceful governance. To test this argument, we draw on methodological advances in integrating event data and combine multiple datasets to study patterns of violence perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2001. The findings of our spatiotemporal analysis show that civilian targeting increases in the period after rebels capture territory from the government compared to areas without territorial takeover, suggesting that life under the roof of rebels is initially more dangerous for civilians.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-13T17:03:49.564784","doi":"10.1093\/isq\/sqaa009","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","International Relations","Models and Methods","Comparative Politics","Political Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/krpny\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/krpny\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/krpny","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/krpny","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/isq\/sqaa009","dataset_id":"socarxiv_102"}

Oftentimes these do not cover substantial parts of the globe or they are difficult to obtain and manipulate, which makes regular updating challenging. The sometimes vast amounts of data can also be computationally and financially costly. The data source we propose instead is cheap, readily and openly available, and updated in real time, and it provides global coverage: Wikipedia. We argue that the number of country page views can be considered a measure of interest or salience, whereas the number of page changes can be considered a measure of controversy between competing political views. We expect these predictors to be particularly successful in capturing tensions before a conflict escalates. We test our argument by predicting changes in battle-related deaths in Africa on the country-month level. We find evidence that country page views do increase predictive performance while page changes do not.

People who grew up in care have an elevated risk of suicidal ideation, behavior and dying by suicide compared to people without care experience.\nObjective: A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of when suicidal ideation occurs and how care-experienced people experience suicidal thoughts, especially when leaving care in England and Germany, is currently not available but would help to inform suicide prevention tailored to care-experienced people across different ages. The current study aims to address this gap.\nParticipants: The online survey included 45 adults with care experience, age 18 to 40, who lived in foster or residential care in England or Germany. Interviews were conducted with 13 care-experienced young adults from both countries.\nMethods: The current study applied a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey and semi-structured interviews with young care-experienced adults from England and Germany. Descriptive statistical and significance tests were conducted to analyze the survey data with SPSS. Framework analysis was used to analyze the interviews.\nResults: The findings show that many participants experienced suicidal thoughts from a young age and at different times up to adulthood. A range of suicidal thoughts and trajectories are identified with an increased risk of suicide for young people with care experience, especially during transitions such as when leaving care in early adulthood.\nConclusion: The study underlines the need for a stronger recognition of suicide prevention in social work and the (leaving) care system across different countries.","tags":["mental health","people with care experience","suicidal ideation","suicide prevention","social work","care leavers","leaving care"],"date":"2023-01-15T19:58:00.994736","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Work","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sjfnb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/sjfnb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/sjfnb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sjfnb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_108"}

As a result, Kenyans online questioned the authenticity of not only the corruption expose but also the organizations\u2019 intentions and preferences so close to the general elections. Using political organization-public relationship model and contingency theory this study thematically examined the attitudes of commenting audience on DCI-Kenya official Facebook page, to interpret users' perceptions towards the organization and the information published (message), the timing factor, and the relationship between perceived source and message authenticity with trust and satisfaction. The findings indicate that DCI-Kenya communication approach was detrimental to the public trust the organization has cultivated in recent years and leaves many dissatisfied with their ability to deliver on their mandate of fighting corruption. This study offers valuable insights for political public relations practitioners, particularly on the importance of timing and source authenticity in heightened political environments. Interestingly, findings indicate a strong link between source authenticity, public's trust, and satisfaction but a weaker link to the message authenticity.","tags":["Perceived message authenticity","Satisfaction","Kenya","Political public relations","Trust","Political Organization-public relationships","Perceived source authenticity"],"date":"2023-01-16T06:57:54.205515","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Public Relations and Advertising","Communication"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dm5h9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/dm5h9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/dm5h9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dm5h9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_109"}

We investigate the extent to which the rate of social assistance use in families with children, as a proxy for child poverty, can be associated with the rate of children in out-of-home care in Finnish municipalities. \nMethods\nData on the annual rate of social assistance use and out-of-home care were drawn from national registers for 216 Finnish municipalities from 1992 to 2021. Linear regression models were utilised to investigate the extent to which the social assistance use rate explained child out-of-home care rates, both spatially and temporally, across municipalities and years while adjusting for the unemployment rate. \nResults\nThe rate of out-of-home care increased from some 700 to 1600 per 100 000 children over the period 1992-2021. A percentage point higher rate of the social assistance use was associated with 44-72 more children placed in out-of-home care per 100 000 children, net of the unemployment rate. This association was stronger in more recent time periods. A smaller association was observed within municipalities over time: a percentage point increase in social assistant use was linked to some 4-25 more children placed in out-of-home care per 100 000 children. \nConclusion\nOut-of-home care is increasingly concentrated in Finnish municipalities with high rates of families receiving social assistance. Preventative child welfare interventions are therefore required in areas with higher rates of economic difficulties among families.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-16T07:56:58.473840","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Work","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gvcw4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gvcw4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gvcw4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gvcw4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_110"}

We report results from a randomized controlled trial (N = 2, 456) of a community-researcher partnership called the Rapid Employment and Development Initiative (READI) Chicago. The program offered an 18-month job alongside cognitive behavioral therapy and other social support. Both algorithmic and human referral methods identified men with strikingly high scope for gun violence reduction: for every 100 people in the control group, there were 11 shooting and homicide victimizations during the 20-month outcome period. Fifty-five percent of the treatment group started programming, comparable to take-up rates in programs for people facing far lower mortality risk. After 20 months, there is no statistically significant change in an index combining three measures of serious violence, the study\u2019s primary outcome. Yet there are signs that this program model has promise. One of the three measures, shooting and homicide arrests, declines 65 percent (p = 0.13 after multiple testing adjustment). Because shootings are so costly, READI generates estimated social savings between $182,000 and $916,000 per participant (p = 0.03), implying a benefit-cost ratio between 4:1 and 18:1. Moreover, participants referred by outreach workers\u2014a pre-specified subgroup\u2014show enormous declines in both arrests and victimizations for shootings and homicides (79 and 43 percent, respectively) that remain statistically significant even after multiple testing adjustments. These declines are concentrated among outreach referrals with higher predicted risk, suggesting that human and algorithmic targeting may work better together.","tags":["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","homicides","empoyment","CBT","crime","jobs","Chicago","shootings"],"date":"2023-01-16T22:31:27.645876","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economics","Labor Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dks29\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/dks29\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/dks29","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dks29","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_114"}

We extend the list of the factors that affect the success of ethnic minorities in the labour market by addressing a so-far neglected explanation: a foreign accent. Using unique data with objective accent measures from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European countries (CILS4EU), we first establish whether foreign-accent effects could be found in a non-experimental setting. Second, we seek to explain the accent effect by human capital, signalling, and discrimination approaches. Finally, we explore the extent to which employment and educational paths of accented speakers reflect their self-selection into jobs for which accented speech is not a precondition. Our findings demonstrate that respondents with a stronger foreign accent are more likely to be found in occupations for which language skills are less essential. This is in line with the human-capital explanation. Self-selection tendencies might also be present, even though the findings are equivocal. Our analyses lend no support to the statistical discrimination explanation, as employers\u2019 perceptions of foreign accents do not vary according to the extent of their contact with accented speakers at work or at home.","tags":["school to work transition","integration","accent","immigrants","labour market entry"],"date":"2023-01-17T09:51:30.701252","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Labor and Labor Movements","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Racial and Ethnic Minorities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rnq2v\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/rnq2v\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/rnq2v","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rnq2v","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_116"}

This article examines intergenerational social class mobility for cohorts born from 1951 to 1980 in Finland. We analyse change across cohorts in the main association between social origins and destinations as well as the intervening associations between origins and education and education and destinations. We investigate how the association between education and destinations differs by origins and by education levels to gain a more complete picture of how meritocratic fairness has changed. We employ full population census and register data, using multiplicative log-linear models. The results suggest that there are some variations in the association between social origins and destinations over cohorts, but they disappear when we consider this association net of education. Educational inequalities have decreased for both men and women, whereas returns to education decrease for men but remain stable for women. Behind these relatively straightforward results is more complexity when we consider how origins, also over cohorts, moderate class returns to education. Accordingly, these results suggest that the labour market is becoming more similar for individuals at different levels of education or coming from different social classes.","tags":["birth-cohorts","Intergenerational social mobility","educational inequalities","gender differences","Finland"],"date":"2023-01-17T10:53:13.600202","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sex and Gender","Population","Comparative and Historical Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology of Education","Children and Youth"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u8qsb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/u8qsb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/u8qsb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u8qsb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_118"}

The results of this study contribute to understanding the complex relationship between social media use and social isolation and inform strategies for promoting social connectedness and well-being in the digital age.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-18T15:02:38.453579","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fb3tq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/fb3tq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/fb3tq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fb3tq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_123"}

Analyses of causal mechanisms have often been restricted to spatially aggregated data and a single context. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). In both countries, immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution in their places of residence. While one would expect immigrant minorities to experience greater improvements from relocations over time given their initial disadvantage, our household fixed effects models controlling for initial pollution levels show that this is not the case. If native households started in a similar situation as immigrants do - the relevant counterfactual - they would experience much higher relocation gains. This process is similar in England and Germany, but the general disadvantage as well as the differences in returns or residential mobility are stronger in England. Furthermore, socio-economic conditions cannot explain the disadvantage in both countries. Our study contributes to the understanding of environmental inequality by highlighting the importance of selective migration in shaping environmental disadvantage among immigrant minorities in England and Germany.","tags":["Residential mobility","Selective migration","Environmental justice","Environmental inequality","Effect heterogeneity","Immigrant minorities","Air pollution","Household fixed effects"],"date":"2023-01-18T16:05:20.996803","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Environmental Sociology","Community and Urban Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Racial and Ethnic Minorities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/snzbx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/snzbx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/snzbx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/snzbx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_126"}

Yet, how internet coverage impacts students\u2019 educational performance remains poorly understood. To addresses this major knowledge gap, this study uses a quasi-experimental approach with Norwegian data to causally examine how the gradual introduction of home broadband internet across municipalities impacted the academic outcomes of lower-secondary school graduates (N = 103,796). Analyses apply sibling fixed-effects models with micro-level registry data from adolescents aged 15 to 16, and compare differences in effects by gender, social background, migrant status, and academic achievement levels. Findings show that the introduction of broadband internet across municipalities brought moderate grade improvements concentrated among boys in the subject areas of Mathematics, Arts and Crafts, Social Sciences, and Norwegian. The positive effect of broadband internet coverage on academic performance was three times larger for boys than for girls. For boys, broadband internet coverage led to strong grade improvements among the lower-achieving and socioeconomically disadvantaged, and to moderate grade benefits among those of Norwegian background, while boys from higher-achieving and socioeconomically privileged groups reduced their grades moderately. By contrast, for girls, broadband internet coverage worsened substantially the academic performance of those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, whereas girls of migrant background obtained higher grades with this expansion of internet. The study findings reveal how the growth of internet coverage impacts adolescent educational performance, but differently across groups, showing a complex intersection across gender, social background, migrant status, and academic achievement levels.","tags":["Media in education","Informal learning","Secondary education"],"date":"2023-01-18T17:46:37.370425","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Children and Youth"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u9v7c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/u9v7c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/u9v7c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u9v7c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_127"}

{"osf_id":"7pkqg","title":"Lifecourse Trajectories and Cross-generation Trends in Social Isolation: Findings from Five Successive British Birth Cohort Studies","description":"Despite growing concerns in the UK about social isolation, there remains a lack of evidence on the extent and time trends of social isolation from longitudinal, population-based studies. There is also little research that assesses the multiple domains of social isolation across the lifecourse and between generations in a holistic way accounting for different contexts. By applying a multi-context, multiple-domain framework of social isolation to 5 successive British birth cohorts, we provide conceptual and empirical understanding of social isolation trajectories across the lifecourse and identify potential generational and sex differences in trends. Where data were available, comparable social isolation indicators were generated to enable lifecourse trajectories and cross-generation trends to be explored. Information on isolation was available across the following relational contexts: household i.e., living alone; partnership, family and friends outside the household; education and employment networks; and community engagement. Trajectories were modelled stratified by sex using a multilevel growth curve framework. We analysed data from 73,847 individuals (48.5% female), in 5 successive cohorts born in 1946 (N=5,362), 1958 (N=16,742), 1970 (N=16,950), 1989-90 (N=15,562), and 2000-01 (N=19,231). Exploration of a range of social isolation indicators across several contexts provided a nuanced picture of social isolation across the lifecourse and between generations in the UK, with no clear pattern of increased or decreased isolation over time. For example, more people are living alone, less women are out of education and employment in midlife, more people are volunteering, but fewer people regularly engage in religious activity. It therefore highlights the need to focus on a range of social isolation indicators across contexts to understand how people compensate for specific types of isolation, and to understand structural differences in social configurations in the UK, which may not only define the timing and sequencing of life transitions but also social isolation.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-19T11:26:10.395703","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7pkqg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/7pkqg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/7pkqg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7pkqg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_129"}

However, not all individuals have equal access to and proficiency with digital technology. This study examines how digital vulnerability, digital ability, and digital literacy vary across individuals with different education levels and income levels. This study finds that there is significant variation in digital vulnerability, digital ability, and digital literacy across education levels and income levels in the platform economy. Specifically, the higher the education level, the higher the digital vulnerability score and the lower the digital ability score. Similarly, the higher the income level, the lower the digital vulnerability score and the lower the digital ability score. Additionally, significant variation in digital literacy was found across education and income levels. These findings suggest that socio-economic factors such as education and income level are important predictors of digital inequality, and that individuals with higher education and income levels may be more cautious with online platforms and thus experience higher levels of digital vulnerability and lower digital ability.","tags":["Digital Abilities","Social Inequalities","Online Platforms","Digital Literacy","Digital Vulnerability"],"date":"2023-01-19T19:37:51.402765","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m98kz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/m98kz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/m98kz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m98kz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_131"}

Global economic trends, the widespread adoption of information technologies, and the emergence of new businesses have all necessitated the development of a new human profile characterized by a focus on life-long learning, self-learning, information literacy, digital citizenship, adaptability, and staying up-to-date with new developments. The learning demands of this new human profile have propelled the global open and distance learning movement, which has not only enriched this way of learning but has also influenced our concepts about the nature of learning. While open and distance learning played a critical role during the global lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing discussions continue about its unique contribution to education. In previous studies, distance education has been discussed as a discipline within education science, but a limited conceptual structure has not allowed this innovative movement to be recognized beyond teaching methods. Given the convergence of open and distance learning with social impacts, a new discussion is needed for this discipline in the post-pandemic era. This paper presents a holistic viewpoint from different perspectives, including literature on open and distance learning and current applications, in order to discuss open and distance learning as a discipline.","tags":["ODL","open education","Open and distance learning","distance education","scientific discipline"],"date":"2023-01-19T21:24:29.522520","doi":null,"subjects":["Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Other Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sg687\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/sg687\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/sg687","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sg687","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_133"}

Employing longitudinal household data from the Panel Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) and a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we find an overall negative effect. This effect is stronger for individuals with caregiving responsibilities. In contrast to our theoretical expectations, our results indicate stronger negative effects on individuals from households with high living standards and high financial resources.

{"osf_id":"wnf5d","title":"Authenticity and the Poor Image in the Age of Deep Learning","description":"Deep learning techniques are increasingly used to automate categorization and identification tasks for large datasets of digital photographs. For rasterized images formats, such as JPEGs, GIFs, and PNGs, the analysis happens on the level of individual pixels. Given this, digital images used in deep learning applications are typically restricted to relatively low-resolution formats to conform to the standards of popular pre-trained neural networks. Using Hito Steyerl\u2019s conception of the \u2018poor image\u2019 as a theoretical frame, this article investigates the use of these relatively low-resolution images in automated analysis, exploring the ways in which they may be deemed preferable to higher-resolution images for deep learning applications. The poor image is rich in value in this context, as it limits the undesirable \u2018noise\u2019 of too much detail. In considering the case of automated art authentication, this article argues that a notion of authenticity is beginning to emerge that raises questions around Walter Benjamin\u2019s often-cited definition in relation to mass image culture.

We find that people with disabilities and chronic health conditions drew boundaries based on unequal health statuses and vulnerabilities and between those who are and are not legitimately entitled to government aid. Underlying these dimensions are a familiar set of moral tropes that respondents use to assert their own superiority and to inveigh their frustrations.

Traditionally, the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices is treated as a binary decision, which simplifies the known complexity around behavior change. We propose a framework for the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices that proposes four key elements: Entirety, variability, sophistication, and longevity. We incorporate this framework into a latent class analysis, using nationwide survey data of U.S. farmers\u2019 cover crop adoption. We identify five types of adopters including non-adopters, previous adopters, conservative new adopters, innovative new adopters, and early adopters. This analysis further challenges existing innovation theories, which suggest that early adopters are not the primary innovators. We discuss the implications of this framework for adoption theory, practice, and other potential applications. These results have significant implications for successful farmer learning and extension services to foster new adoption, re-adoption, as well as continued and increasingly complex adoption of sustainable agriculture practices.","tags":["sustainable agriculture","framework","innovation theory","cover crops","farmer adoption"],"date":"2023-01-21T17:38:50.486061","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/253uf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/253uf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/253uf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/253uf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_142"}

However, their research models usually cover only a restricted number of explanatory variables, and many suffer from omitted variable bias. This study contributes to the literature by advocating a sound approach to selecting the control variables for empirical capital structure studies. We applied two linear LASSO inference approaches and the double machine learning (DML) framework to the LASSO, random forest, decision tree, and gradient boosting learners to evaluate the marginal contributions of three proposed determinants; cash holdings, non-debt tax shield, and current ratio. While some studies did not use these variables in their models, others obtained contradictory results. Our findings have revealed that cash holdings, current ratio, and non-debt tax shield are crucial factors that substantially affect the leverage decisions of firms and should be controlled in empirical capital structure studies.","tags":["Gradient Boosting","Random Forest","Determinants of Capital Structure","Decision Tree","Double Machine Learning","Leverage Ratio","LASSO"],"date":"2023-01-22T11:07:44.412544","doi":"10.1002\/jcaf.22647","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economics","Finance"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e26qf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/e26qf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/e26qf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e26qf","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/jcaf.22647","dataset_id":"socarxiv_145"}
{"osf_id":"7pbd8","title":"Economic predictors of financial stress","description":"Financial stress, defined as the subjective experience of lacking financial resources to cope with demands, has profound implications for well-being, health, cognitive performance, and decision-making. In empirical studies, financial stress is often associated with economic correlates such as low income or debt. Typically, such correlates are considered in isolation, which may result in spurious findings. In the current study, we examined the association of financial stress with five potential correlates in conjunction: income, saving, debts, income volatility, and employment. We used a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,114). Results showed that low income, low savings, and unemployment were independently associated with more financial stress. Income moderated the association between savings and unemployment on the one hand and financial stress on the other: low levels of savings and unemployment were associated with more financial stress for low-income households. We found mixed support for debts and no support for income volatility as correlates of financial stress. These results imply that research and policy in the domain of financial stress should have a broader scope than income alone and should take a more integrative approach to households\u2019 financial situation, particularly savings and employment. Future studies should further unravel the causal directions of the associations between households\u2019 economic situation and financial stress. We discuss potential policy interventions to reduce financial stress and improve financial decision-making and well-being.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-22T12:45:20.181233","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology","Social Psychology"],"is_published":null,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7pbd8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/7pbd8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/7pbd8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7pbd8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_146"}

Within this, responsibility for surface water flood management is largely delegated to 152 local authorities. In this research, the local flood risk management strategies (LFRMSs) produced by these local authorities were audited using a systematic, largely objective method to identify alignment with a range of factors that good strategies should include. The aim was to determine if the strategies were meeting their minimum statutory requirements and whether they were developing robust climate change adaptation plans. The findings show that LFRMSs are, in the main, meeting their minimum statutory requirements. However, there is a widespread issue across most LFRMSs regarding inadequate consideration of increasing surface water flood risk from climate changes. Therefore, we conclude that surface water flood risk plans are not adequate in England largely because of the range in quality across the local authorities. Nonetheless, there is some evidence of good practice within the LFRMS portfolio, which is discussed in the context of the ongoing update process of these strategies. This research is the first examination of the full suite of LFRMSs and, therefore, is the first time that the complete approach to surface water flood management has been assessed in England.","tags":["climate change","environmental studies","surface water flooding","risk management","adaptation","policy appraisal","climate policy"],"date":"2023-01-22T16:04:01.457967","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Policy","Environmental Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/be4qx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/be4qx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/be4qx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/be4qx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_147"}

An increasing number of studies in sustainable tourism have attempted to develop and test in the field the effectiveness of behavioural change interventions aimed at enticing tourism stakeholders in behaving more sustainably. These efforts have focused primarily on tourists. Employees have been largely neglected as potential agents of change, despite the substantial environmental consequences of their behaviours. This article pioneers this area of investigation. In a quasi-experimental field study conducted during regular operations of two hotels in Europe, we demonstrate that an equity-theory based behavioural intervention can successfully reduce the number of single-use shampoos dispensed by hotel cleaning staff during daily routine room cleans. Results are of immediate value to managers of tourism businesses \u2013 especially those of small and medium sized accommodation providers who do not have the financial means to make major infrastructure changes \u2013 by equipping them with a practical measure they can easily deploy to reduce the negative impact on the environment of their operations while also reducing their operating cost.","tags":["workforce","experiment","equity theory","staff","sustainability"],"date":"2023-01-23T03:19:43.319257","doi":"10.1080\/09669582.2022.2131796","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8aw5d\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/8aw5d\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/8aw5d","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8aw5d","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/09669582.2022.2131796","dataset_id":"socarxiv_149"}
{"osf_id":"g8arw","title":"Subjective Inequity Aversion: Unfair Inequality, Subjective Well-Being, and Preferences for Redistribution","description":"This paper argues that `inequity aversion' can be understood as an emotional reaction to perceived injustice that arises from individuals\u2019 comparisons of their own and others\u2019 outcomes to a subjective fairness ideal. In particular, we assume that subjective perceptions of inequity and not objective deviations from equality are crucial to understanding how individuals react to inequality. The paper formalizes these insights by adapting the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) model of inequity aversion replacing the fairness frame of objective equality with subjectively perceived equity. We test this model using data from the European Social Survey 2018 analyzing the association between respondents' perceived fairness of own, top, and bottom incomes with subjective well-being and preferences for redistribution. Results from spline regressions with country-fixed effects indicate that perceived injustice of own and top incomes is positively related to individuals' subjective well-being. For the perceived injustice of bottom incomes, we find no substantive relationships with subjective well-being. Further analyses indicate a positive link between the perceived injustice of bottom and top incomes and preferences for redistribution. In sum, our results suggest that injustice perceived for oneself is connected to utility while perceived injustice of others is related to increased willingness to back redistributive policy proposals even if they are not in line with material self-interest.","tags":["Fairness","Redistribution","Inequality","Inequity aversion","Subjective well-being"],"date":"2023-01-23T13:15:19.676614","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economic Sociology","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g8arw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/g8arw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/g8arw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g8arw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_150"}

While there is little doubt that rapid technological progress has far-reaching economic, social, and political consequences, little is known about viable and effective policies governments can implement to assist workers and communities in adjusting to a fast-changing economic landscape and rising labor market insecurity. This paper focuses on the ability of public policies to moderate technology-induced labor market vulnerability and its well-documented political downstream consequences. First, I suggest to theoretically classify policy responses according to their intended goal into a three-fold typology, distinguishing between investment, steering, and compensation policies. After that, I provide a detailed discussion of the current state of the empirical literature on how such policy responses affect workers coping with technological change. In the last section, I discuss to what extent these findings can guide the adoption of policies to help workers adapt to technological change and point out potential avenues for future research.","tags":["automation","policy responses","digitalization","technological change","social policy","taxation","regulation"],"date":"2023-01-23T18:20:42.446961","doi":null,"subjects":["Labor Economics","Political Economy","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Comparative Politics","Political Science","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kwxn2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/kwxn2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/kwxn2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kwxn2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_152"}

In this study, we address this puzzle and ask: What attracts refugees to deprived areas, and can their seemingly unfortunate residential choices be understood as moves to labor market opportunity after all? Empirically, we draw on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, track the location of more than 2,500 refugee respondents, and estimate discrete choice models across all German counties and postcodes. Our results confirm the existence of the refugee-mobility puzzle and complicate recent critiques of dispersal policies and restrictions by suggesting that refugees\u2019 need for affordable housing and their desire to be close to (co-ethnic) friends and family may turn into an unintended lock-in factor in the mid- and long-run.","tags":["residential choice","secondary migration","refugees","integration"],"date":"2023-01-24T12:56:27.425529","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Community and Urban Sociology","Population","Urban Studies and Planning","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Racial and Ethnic Minorities","International Migration"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rnzbc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/rnzbc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/rnzbc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rnzbc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_158"}

To understand how public audiences interpret this information, we conducted a mixed method study with U.S. adults. Participants read a news article about preprint COVID-19 vaccine research in early April 2021, just as the vaccine was becoming widely available to the U.S. public. We modified the article to test two ways of conveying uncertainty (hedging of scientific claims and mention of preprint status) in a 2 \u00d7 2 between-participants factorial design. To complement this, we collected open-ended data to assess participants\u2019 understanding of the concept of a scientific preprint. In all, participants who read hedged (vs. unhedged) versions of the article reported less favorable vaccine attitudes and intentions and found the scientists and news reporting less trustworthy. These effects were moderated by participants\u2019 epistemic beliefs and their preference for information about scientific uncertainty. However, there was no impact of describing the study as a preprint, and participants\u2019 qualitative responses indicated a limited understanding of the concept. We discuss implications of these findings for communicating initial scientific evidence to the public and we outline important next steps for research and theory-building.","tags":["Hedging","COVID-19","Framing","Preprint","Uncertain Science","Communication","Vaccines","News","Credibility","Scientific Uncertainty"],"date":"2023-01-24T16:29:41.536727","doi":"10.1080\/10410236.2023.2164954","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Communication","Communication"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wcd58\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/wcd58\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/wcd58","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wcd58","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10410236.2023.2164954","dataset_id":"socarxiv_160"}

Numerous studies have identified the detrimental effects of excessive EHR use and after-hours work, including physician burnout, physician attrition, and appointment delays. However, EHR time is not purely an exogenous factor as it depends on physician usage behavior that could have important operational consequences.\nInterestingly, prior literature has not considered this topic rigorously. In this paper, we investigate how\nphysicians' workflow decisions on when to perform EHR tasks affect: (1) total time on EHR and (2) time\nspent after work.\nMethodology\/Results: Our data comprise around 150,000 appointments from 74 physicians from a large\nAcademic Medical Center Family Medicine unit. Our dataset contains detailed, process-level time stamps\nof appointment progression and EHR use. We find that the effect of working on EHR systems depends on\nwhether the work is done before or after an appointment. Pre-appointment EHR work reduces total EHR\nworkload and after-work hours spent on EHR. Post-appointment EHR work reduces after-work hours on\nEHR but increases total EHR time. We find that increasing idle time between appointments can encourage\nboth pre- and post-appointment EHR work.\nManagerial implications: Our results not only help us understand the timing and structure of work on\nsecondary tasks, more generally, but also will help healthcare administrators create EHR workflows and\nappointment schedules to reduce physician burnout associated with excessive EHR use.","tags":["Workload Management","Scheduling","Task-switching","Service Operations"],"date":"2023-01-24T19:13:52.637256","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2aw63\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/2aw63\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/2aw63","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2aw63","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_161"}

International evidence indicates that these institutions have achieved high vaccination rates and Canadian public health agencies exclude them entirely from the list of institutions at risk of outbreaks. On the other hand, influential observers, and postsecondary institutions themselves insist that not only achieving, but also maintaining, \u201cup-to-date\u201d vaccination - through mandates if necessary \u2013 remains critical to contain the crisis. However, with the increasing recognition that vaccines do not stop viral spread, that young populations are at exceedingly low risk of severe Covid-19, hospitalization, and death - with a survival rate of over 99.98% - and that mandated medical interventions have a troubled history with repercussions to this day, the soundness of current vaccination policies in postsecondary institutions cannot be assumed. \n\nDrawing from the medicalization tradition and interpretive phenomenology, our study explores, through in-depth interviews, how vaccination policies within and beyond postsecondary institutions have shaped perceptions of the Covid-19 crisis, beliefs about the role, risks, and benefits of vaccination, and life choices and chances of students in Canada. We find that students largely comply with vaccination policies, whether by conviction, convenience, or coercion, and that the discourse and social practices promoted by the policies limit opportunities for free debate and exchange across vaccination statuses. Regardless of this status, students do resist, albeit very limitedly given the high cost of noncompliance. We discuss the implications of our findings for policy, equity, and for the power of medical social control in the Covid-19 era.

Student assessment methodologies play a substantial role in the quality assurance of engineering education. Better assessment requires explicit knowledge of various types and methods of assessment. However, it is observed that most engineering educators do not possess factual knowledge about effective assessment methods and the underlying educational theories. Besides, it is argued that engineering educators are not well-informed about the formative feedback approaches associated with assessment for learning. Performer-friendly feedback on students\u2019 achievements is indispensable since it aids students in recognising their strengths and weaknesses in learning. Hence, leveraging assessment methodologies can ascertain quality assurance in engineering education. If the integrity in student assessment is achieved tolerably well, the quality of the teaching-learning process will considerably improve. Effective assessment methods not only help students in their learning progress but also assist in enhancing the quality of teaching. Against this backdrop, this short-paper presents some practical recommendations for improving assessment methodologies and assuring quality in engineering education.","tags":["engineering educator","Assessment","teacher training","engineering education","formative feedback","assessment strategies"],"date":"2023-01-25T09:30:28.204085","doi":null,"subjects":["Education","Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rzh73\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/rzh73\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/rzh73","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rzh73","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_164"}

Integrating data from New York City\u2019s Stop, Question, and Frisk program from 2008-2012 with extensive neighborhood measures, our analyses reveal that white neighborhoods along boundaries experienced substantially elevated levels of police stops even after conditioning on a wide array of potential confounders. This rela-tionship is partially mediated by elevated crime along racial boundaries. Still, a sizeable direct effect persists, indicative of the racialized social control of spaces. Further, the police tend to require less suspicion before deciding to conduct stops in white neighborhoods along racial boundaries, but only for Black and Hispanic suspects.

We collected data from our exploration, but surprisingly we discovered that a part of such data were suitable to answer different questions.\nBackground. Scientific research in such field is characterized by a hot dispute between Cognitivism and Embodiment theories; such dispute has come to a substantial stalemate. In order to contribute to overcome such stalemate, we thought it was worth exploring the pragmatics of this research (the phenomenology of how, actually, current methods are applied by professional researchers). So, we planned a field research worldwide aimed to ask professional researchers their actual methodological guide-lines and their stances and opinions on related matters.\nMethodology. We used the Internet to contact the greatest amount possible, world wide, of researchers with adequate seniority. We designed a dedicated questionnaire (opened questions), and we explored universities worldwide: in total we explored 346 institutes \/ departments belonging to 51 different universities, and examined 7.535 university cards (personal profiles of researchers) collecting 1.041 suitable researchers\u2019 names and e-mail addresses (with 72 more to be added coming from special lists). We invited all of them to join the research, and waited for their consent in order to send them the questionnaire. The privacy rules, based on the European GDPR\/2016, were rigorously respected\nPrincipal Findings. The first kind of results come from the analysis of the answers given to the filled questionnaires returned to us. We did not receive an amount of answers suitable to conduct a meaningful statistical analysis (just 16 filled questionnaires collected on 1.113 contacted researchers); we anyway analysed the received questionnaires. In an extreme synthesis, we found great differentiation and dispersion among the researchers\u2019 answers; given also the scarce number of the answers, no convergence on common concepts was found.\nThe second kind of results come from the analysis of the interaction process among the authors and the sample, which, fortunately, we had accurately kept trace of. The collected information rendered the shape and the culture of the interactions (via the Internet) among researchers the way they are currently managed in the sample of scientific community we explored; so we could outline some features of behaviours and attitudes, as well as some hints on the psychology of respondents. We found that the observed reactions of the sample are coherent with a present times specific culture of scientific research already pointed out by available literature: tendency to industrialize its pragmatics and to emphasize the amount of products instead of quality. What leaves no room for overt debate, paves the way to conformism and prevents a functional use of the Internet in the interactions among researchers.","tags":["Methodology","Scientific community","Scientific community psychology","Knowledge studies","Scientific community sociology","Pragmatics of field research","Scientific community behaviours","Cognitive processes studies"],"date":"2023-01-25T18:17:19.798496","doi":null,"subjects":["Community Psychology","Psychology","Sociology","Rationality and Society","Social Psychology","Social Psychology and Interaction","Communication","Culture","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science, Knowledge, and Technology","Critical and Cultural Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8gv92\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/8gv92\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/8gv92","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8gv92","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_168"}
{"osf_id":"v85xc","title":"When is a hand-axe a planned-axe? Exploring morphological variability in the Acheulean","description":"The handaxe is an iconic stone tool form used to define and symbolise both the Acheulean and the wider Palaeolithic. There has long been debate around the extent of its morphological variability between sites, and the role that extrinsic factors (especially raw material, blank type, and the extent of resharpening) have played in driving this variability, but there has been a lack of high-resolution examinations of these factors in the same study. In this paper, we present a 2D geometric morphometric analysis of 1097 handaxes from across Africa, the Levant, and western Europe to examine the patterning of this variability and what it can tell us about hominin behaviour. We replicate the findings of previous studies, that handaxe shape varies significantly between sites and entire continental regions, but we find no evidence for raw material, blank type, or resharpening in determining this pattern. What we do find, however, is that markers of reduction trajectory vary substantially between sites, suggesting that handaxes were deployed differently according to hominin need at a given site. We argue this is reflective of a continuum of reduction strategies, from those focused on the maintenance of a sharp cutting edge (i.e. direct use in cutting activities), to those focused on maintaining tip shapes, and perhaps a corresponding production of flakes. Implications for hominin behavioural flexibility are discussed.","tags":["Acheulean","Lithic Variability","Behavioural Flexibility","Geometric Morphometrics","Handaxes"],"date":"2023-01-25T18:40:39.751712","doi":null,"subjects":["Archaeological Anthropology","Anthropology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v85xc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/v85xc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/v85xc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v85xc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_169"}
{"osf_id":"ynqa8","title":"Fairness and Signaling in Bargaining Games","description":"Unfairness emerges in bargaining games under a variety of conditions. Two effects increase the probability that a simulated society converges to unfairness: (i) the Red King effect produces advantage in favor of members of the larger group; (ii) the Bargaining Power effect produces advantage in favor of the group with more powerful individuals. This paper shows how these effects are modulated by relationships between unobservable and observable traits (signals). We investigate three models. First, when an agent can choose signals, we find a relationship between unfairness and distinctive signaling. Second, we introduce stochastic signaling, in which signals are somewhat (de-)correlated with an underlying trait. Third, we introduce adaptive tolerance, in which agents create a signal using a partition of the underlying trait space. It is shown computationally that, in each case, there is a fall in the proportion of societies converging on unequal resource distribution. Analysis supports the idea that the underlying phenomenon linking all these is the mutual information between the signal and the unobservable trait.","tags":["cultural evolution","signaling","game theory","unfairness","inequality","mutual information"],"date":"2023-01-26T10:51:48.916782","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Other Economics","Communication","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ynqa8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ynqa8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ynqa8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ynqa8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_170"}

Due to this, there is fierce competition among companies across the globe in order to ensure that they are able to benefit from the new technological developments. Globally, the United States and Asia are emerging as the two global leaders in this area. Over the years, there has been a significant change in the landscape of emerging technologies since Alan Turing first asked in the 1950s if machines could think like humans. Emerging technologies will enhance economic growth and efficiency in the future. It is possible to greatly improve decision-making when large amounts of data are analysed by improving efficiency. It is likely that new products and services, new markets, and new industries will be created as a result, which will in turn boost consumer demand and generate new revenue streams. On the other hand, emerging technologies may also have a profound effect on society and the economy. The creation of superman-like organisations could negatively affect the economy, according to several researchers. Further, it may lead to a wider gap between developed and developing countries, as well as a rise in the demand for workers with emerging skills and technologies, thereby creating job losses. The latter trend may have a significant impact on the labor market in the long run.","tags":["Future Blueprint of Technology and Society","Technology and Sustainability","Impact of New Technologies on Society","Ethics and New Technologies","New Technologies and Society"],"date":"2023-01-26T12:43:39.730262","doi":"10.31435\/rsglobal\/053","subjects":["Organization Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ypgsh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ypgsh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ypgsh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ypgsh","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31435\/rsglobal\/053","dataset_id":"socarxiv_172"}
{"osf_id":"6ugz5","title":"Text as Big Data: Develop codes of practice for rigorous computational text analysis in energy social science","description":"Augmenting traditional social science methods with computational analysis is crucial if we are to exploit the vast digital archives of text data that have become available over the past two decades. In this journal, Benites-Lazaro et al. (2018) showcase this in an application of topic modeling and other computational methods to an actor-specific examination of changes in policy discourse on ethanol in Brazil and point out methodological promises and challenges. However, their contribution also highlights the need for establishing codes of practice for computational text analysis. In this perspective, we discuss five areas for improvement when treating text as big data in light of guiding principles from computational research \u2013 transparency, reproducibility and validation \u2013 to facilitate rigorous research practice: (1) full transparency over data collection and corpus construction, (2) comprehensive method descriptions that enable reproducibility by other researchers, (3) application of rigorous model validation procedures, (4) results interpretation based on primary text and clear research design and (5) critical discussion and contextualization of main findings. We conclude that the energy social science community needs to develop codes of practice to build on the promising research within the field of computational text analysis and suggest first steps into this direction.","tags":["Automated content analysis","Topic modeling","Text mining","Discourse analysis","Big data","Computational text analysis"],"date":"2023-01-26T15:25:50.386610","doi":"10.1016\/j.erss.2020.101691","subjects":["Communication","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics","Computational Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6ugz5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/6ugz5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/6ugz5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6ugz5","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.erss.2020.101691","dataset_id":"socarxiv_173"}
{"osf_id":"x5q9j","title":"Can intensification of cattle ranching reduce deforestation in the Amazon? Insights from an agent-based social-ecological model","description":"Deforestation in the Amazon with its vast consequences for the ecosystem and climate is largely related to subsequent land use for cattle ranching.\nIn addition to conservation policies, proposals to reduce deforestation include measures to intensify cattle ranching. However, the effects of land-use intensification on deforestation are debated in the literature. This paper introduces the abacra model, a stylized agent-based model to study the interplay of deforestation and the intensification of cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon. The model combines social learning and ecological processes with market dynamics. In the model, agents adopt either an extensive or semi-intensive strategy of cattle ranching based on the success of their neighbors. They earn their income by selling cattle on a stylized market. We present a comprehensive analysis of the model with statistical methods and find that it produces highly non-linear transient outcomes in dependence on key parameters like the rate of social interaction and elasticity of the cattle price. We show that under many environmental and economic conditions, intensification does not reduce deforestation rates and sometimes even has a detrimental effect on deforestation. Anti-deforestation policies incentivizing fast intensification can only lower deforestation rates under conditions in which the local cattle market saturates.","tags":["Land-use intensification","Agent-based modeling","Social-ecological systems","Pasture management","Amazon deforestation"],"date":"2023-01-26T15:50:35.537308","doi":"10.1016\/j.ecolecon.2018.12.025","subjects":["Regional Economics","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Agricultural and Resource Economics","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x5q9j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/x5q9j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/x5q9j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x5q9j","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ecolecon.2018.12.025","dataset_id":"socarxiv_174"}

Using novel survey data collected from Kaduna, the state with the third highest incidence of pastoral conflicts in Nigeria, this study fills these gaps. The regression results show that exposure to pastoral conflicts cause distrust of members of the Fulani ethnic group and Muslims; although the size of the effect is much larger for the Fulani compared to Muslims. This shows that the population in Kaduna tend to conflate the Fulani with Muslims. Religious polarization was found to catalyze the process of resource conflicts turning religious.","tags":["Pastoral conflict","Religion","Kaduna State","Nigeria","Fulani","trust","Farmer-herder conflict"],"date":"2023-01-26T20:33:33.228408","doi":null,"subjects":["Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Comparative Politics","Political Science","Agricultural and Resource Economics","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tgw5f\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/tgw5f\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/tgw5f","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tgw5f","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_175"}
{"osf_id":"vwbq2","title":"EU funds absorption for Romanian rural municipalities: a spatial distribution","description":"This study analyzes the spatial differences in EU funds absorption among Romanian rural municipalities through the 2014-2020 programming period. The absorption capacity for EU funds is measured by the volume of spent EU funds by inhabitant, for each Romanian rural municipality. The results of the analysis highlight the importance of the territorial dimension when studying the distribution of EU funds among the rural municipalities of Romania. Affiliation with a specific development region (NUTS 2), county (NUTS 3) or a functional urban area (FUA) is used to differentiate the volume of absorbed EU funds. Levels of fiscal capacity, locality development, EU and state budget funding experience, and population dynamics in 2021 compared to those in 2014 are also used to distinguish between categories of municipalities receiving EU funds. In Romania, rural municipalities with higher levels of absorbed EU funding are, to a statistically higher extent, located in development regions in the Center, North\u2012West, South West and West of the country; in communes with no change, or even an increase, in population between 2021 and 2014; in the highest quartile of fiscal capacity and in communes with experience with EU funding from the preceding programming period. This article adds to the growing body of territorial evidence and can be used as a policy instrument to more closely examine the intervention tools embedded in EU funding policy. From a systemic approach, the results of the analysis are valuable for the design of integrated place-based strategies for EU, national and local level stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life for citizens living in rural areas.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-27T12:51:05.218982","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Social Statistics","Geography","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Political Science","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vwbq2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/vwbq2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/vwbq2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vwbq2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_176"}

{"osf_id":"9543p","title":"Environmental impacts associated with the manufacturing of personalised medicines: a scoping review","description":"This report presents the findings of a project funded by UCL\u2019s Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub. This Hub aims to explore the challenges associated with manufacturing personalised medicines. Personalised medicines aim to move therapies from population-based, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approaches (medicines designed for use by a population) to stratified approaches (medicines targeted to specific sub-populations based on particular (e.g., molecular\/genetic) characteristics), and ultimately to approaches whereby therapeutic interventions are tailored to the specific molecular characteristics of one individual. This move has implications for medicines manufacturing processes. These processes have typically relied on forecasted demand, but as medicines become increasingly targeted to an individual\u2019s characteristics, manufacturing approaches need to change. For example, for therapeutic interventions tailored to one individual, the manufacturing process has to wait until the individual\u2019s molecular profile has been determined so that this information can be incorporated into therapeutic production. Other aspects of personalised medicine\u2013such as the use of wearable sensors and 3D printing to customise medication dosages\u2013may also require different approaches to manufacturing. The economic, social, and environmental aspects of any innovation are a necessary component of decision-making about implementation and use. This is the premise of sustainable development. In this report, we aim to better understand how the adverse environmental costs associated with personalised medicines manufacturing are being considered in the academic literature.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-28T06:44:36.897807","doi":null,"subjects":["Medical Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Environmental Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9543p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/9543p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/9543p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9543p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_179"}

The study marks the beginning of the big data era in 2010 and explains the variation in the emergence of data protection regulations by examining the international problem-solving landscape, societal institutional organization, and individual interactions pressures. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has had a significant impact on the alignment of regulations in other countries and the behavior of the private sector in terms of regulatory compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States is a response to a growing social movement against corporativism and the abuse of personal data by large companies. The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China focuses on international data sovereignty and aims to protect the personal information of Chinese citizens from foreign companies and countries. Overall, the data protection case shows that when new technologies emerge, there is a natural tendency for regulatory convergence. The GDPR is an example of a regulatory solution that has been successfully propagated, due to the EU strong institutional reaction to new circumstances and ability to negotiate with all parties to create solutions for complex problems.","tags":["Knowledge and technology governance","California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)","Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)","General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"],"date":"2023-01-28T20:15:37.183622","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Policy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v6uf3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/v6uf3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/v6uf3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v6uf3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_180"}

{"osf_id":"f4zvy","title":"Governing knowledge and technology: The European approach on data protection","description":"At a systems level data, knowledge and technology are interconnected. Data is the raw material that is used to create knowledge, and technology is the application of knowledge. In recent decades, the growth of data technology has been exponential due to the development of digital technologies such as computers and the internet. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented in response to the increasing use of data by private companies and the inadequacy of the 1995 Directive on Data Protection in addressing these issues. The GDPR has effectively strengthened data protection in the EU through its harmonization with the European Data Protection Board, the requirement for Data Protection Officers within data controllers' organizations, and the implementation of clear rules and explicit fines. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of the regulation, including its selective nature regarding the growth of personal data and the potential negative impact on citizens' knowledge about themselves. An efficiency and efficacy analysis found that it has contributed to the development of a common European data protection culture and the protection of individuals' rights, though it has had a negative impact on the financial performance of some companies. A systems analysis using systems thinking illustrates the implications of the regulation for the functioning of societal systems and the relationships between them. As data technology and the use of data-driven synthetic agents like AI continue to advance, it may be necessary to consider alternative approaches, such as focus on anonymization, in future addiction to the data protection regulatory framework.","tags":["Digital Economy","Public Policy","General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"],"date":"2023-01-28T20:41:28.438554","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Policy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f4zvy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/f4zvy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/f4zvy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f4zvy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_182"}

The results contradict external sources of data such as referrals to gender clinics and signatures on a pro-transgender petition. The results are also internally inconsistent when the various categories of gender identity are correlated across geography, and when compared to the results for sexual orientation. The spurious results were produced by a badly flawed question on gender identity, which was originally formulated by a transgender campaigning organization. The question evidently confused a substantial number of respondents who erroneously declared their gender identity to differ from their natal sex. Confusion is manifested by the overrepresentation of people lacking English proficiency or educational qualifications in the most suspect gender categories.

Toward an analytical and operational framework","description":"Models of research systems increasingly emphasize collaborations between networks of heterogeneous actors, to both produce knowledge and formulate interdisciplinary responses to societal challenges and market needs. In this context, researchers\u2019 goals and practices are required to satisfy professional requirements for new scientific findings and societal demand for relevant knowledge. Researchers may need also to find ways to reconcile tensions between these two missions. This article proposes an analytical and operational framework that incorporates individual, organizational and process-context factors to explain distinct configurations of scientific and societal impacts from research. The framework emphasises the role of productive interactions with different nonacademic actors as a mechanism for reconciling the scientific and societal missions of research.","tags":["Analytical framework","Scientific impact","Research quality","Societal impact"],"date":"2023-01-30T11:57:07.585635","doi":"10.1093\/scipol\/scy023","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Science and Technology Studies","Science, Knowledge, and Technology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f6pnz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/f6pnz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/f6pnz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f6pnz","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/scipol\/scy023","dataset_id":"socarxiv_189"}

However, not all grandparents make such investments equally, and between-grandparent differences in this regard can be predicted based on paternity uncertainty, lineage, and grandparents\u2019 sex. Using population-based data for English and Welsh adolescents (n = 1,430), we examined whether the death of the most important grandparent (in terms of investment), the maternal grandmother (MGM), changes relative support for existing hypotheses predicting differential grandparental-investment patterns. To contrast the predictions of the grandparental-investment hypotheses, we used generalized order-restricted information criterion approximation (GORICA). We consequently found that, when MGMs are alive, the most-supported hypothesis is \u2018discriminative grandparental solicitude\u2019, which ranks grandparental investment as MGMs &gt; maternal grandfathers (MGFs) &gt; paternal grandmothers (PGMs) &gt; paternal grandfathers (PGFs). However, when MGMs are deceased, the paternity uncertainty hypothesis (MGFs = PGMs &gt; PGFs) receives the most support; this is due to increased investment by PGMs. Thus, the standard evolutionary hypothesis explaining differential grandparental investment, and paternity uncertainty, receives the most support only when the heaviest investors (i.e., MGMs) are deceased.","tags":["informative hypotheses","sex","lineage","grandparental investment"],"date":"2023-01-30T14:10:28.085149","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sex and Gender","Population","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Children and Youth","Family"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/p3hz2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/p3hz2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/p3hz2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/p3hz2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_191"}

Opportunities to access data through purpose built platforms and repositories, combined with emerging data and meta-data curation practices are expanding data availability in many fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying scientific research careers, motivated by opportunities to link empirical datasets to construct new analyses that address remaining and emerging knowledge gaps. The research career conceptual framework (RCCF) emerges from a review of relevant theories and empirical findings regarding research careers. The paper reviews existing models and develops a typology of research careers. It also compiles a list of variables drawn from the literature on research careers. Two preliminary demonstrations of linking datasets to address empirical questions are outlined. The final discussion advocates an approach to emerging data opportunities that combines theories and models with empirical research questions as being superior to an approach that produces ad hoc explanations on the basis of  \u2018data fishing\u2019 exercises.","tags":["Research careers","RISIS platform","Open data"],"date":"2023-01-30T18:33:49.808662","doi":"10.1007\/s10961-018-9659-3","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Science, Knowledge, and Technology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3bzmd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/3bzmd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/3bzmd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3bzmd","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10961-018-9659-3","dataset_id":"socarxiv_193"}

I then provide a typology of states of shared awareness between purely private and common knowledge, then discuss patterns of behavior each of them gives rise to, including the second-order impression management and cognitive hierarchy; and further analyze the location analysis actors are to perform to situate themselves and others in this awareness structure, and patterns of cognitive hierarchy emerging from these efforts. I then proceed to the evolution of the awareness structure and careers of various signals this evolution launches.

Current theory suggests that the heterogeneity of metapopulation structure can help adaptations diffuse throughout a population. In this paper, we develop an agent-based model of the spread of adaptations in populations with minority-majority metapopulation structure, where subpopulations learn more or less frequently from their own group compared to the other group. In our simulations, minority-majority-structured populations with moderate degrees of in-group preference better spread and maintained an adaptation compared to populations with more equal-sized groups and weak homophily. Minority groups act as incubators for an adaptation, while majority groups act as reservoirs for an adaptation once it has spread widely. This means that adaptations diffuse throughout populations better when minority groups start out knowing an adaptation, as Indigenous populations often do, while cohesion among majority groups further promotes adaptation diffusion.  Our work advances the goal of this theme issue by developing new theoretical insights and demonstrating the utility of cultural evolutionary theory and methods as important tools in the nascent science of culture that climate change adaptation needs.","tags":["cultural evolution","cooperation","adaptation","agent-based modeling","homophily","sustainability","collective action"],"date":"2023-02-01T07:49:57.237299","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Anthropology","Culture","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social and Cultural Anthropology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/28eaj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/28eaj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/28eaj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/28eaj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_197"}

The results suggest having three or more children has negative effects on cognition.  We use the same approach in the US Health and Retirement Study, which allows a broader set of cognitive outcomes, ages 50+, and a different context.

We improve the first stage by using a two-sample IV approach with data from the US Census.  Unfortunately, the combined limitations of our smaller HRS sample and weak first stage lead to imprecise results, often suggesting positive effects for males.

However, the states across the country are not equally affected. Moreover, the nature of the conflicts and the conditions under which they occur vary across Nigeria\u2019s states. Relying on novel survey data that was collected from Kaduna, the second state most affected by violent conflict in Nigeria, this study examines the effect that exposure to violent conflict has on the socioeconomic condition of households. The instrumental variable regressions show that violent conflict worsens the socioeconomic condition of households. A unit increase in the number of violent conflicts within the 30km buffer around the dwellings of the households increases the likelihood of them being unable to meet their food needs by 0.3 percent. This finding is robust to alternative data, buffer sizes, and estimation techniques. Improvements in state capacity was found to reduce the likelihood of households being in a poor socioeconomic condition. This is because economic activity does not thrive in an environment characterized by insecurity.","tags":["Poverty","Kaduna State","Nigeria","Violent conflict","Conflict exposure","Socioeconomic condition"],"date":"2023-02-01T17:09:14.751243","doi":null,"subjects":["Income Distribution","Econometrics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Comparative Politics","Political Science","Economics","Growth and Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zjs8k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/zjs8k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/zjs8k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zjs8k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_199"}

This study fills that gap. Relying upon the horizontal inequalities (HEs) theory, this study examines the effect of ethnic marginalization and socioeconomic condition on support for secession. Among members of the Igbo ethnic group, perceived ethnic marginalization was found to increase the likelihood of supporting secession. Keeping all covariates at their mean levels, a unit increase in perceived ethnic marginalization increases the likelihood to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with secession by 13 percent. Socioeconomic condition was measured at the individual, household, and communal levels. The individual and household measures had no effect on support for secession, but the communal measure did. However, the results contravened the prediction of the HEs theory: improvements in socioeconomic condition at the communal level rather increased the likelihood of supporting secession. Belonging to the Igbo ethnic group was also found to increase the likelihood of supporting secession.

Very important goals are at stake\u2014protection of individual rights, satisfaction of patients\u2019 needs, technological innovation, economic growth\u2014and reconciling them is a formidable challenge. A key tension emerges from the rift between the altruistic and disinterested motivation expected from citizens contributing their data and samples, and the central role of for-profit companies in the development and commercialisation of medical innovations stemming from such data. Turning gifts into proprietary assets raises questions of fairness, trust and exploitation. The private appropriation of data is discussed through a philosophical dialogue modelled after Thomas More\u2019s Utopia. A fictional character presents the central idea: in order to empower people to enter the data market with adequate bargaining power and thus achieving a much fairer distribution of benefits and burdens, biological data should be owned collectively by regional citizen corporations. Some of the pros and cons of this proposal are then discussed by the various characters participating in the dialogue.","tags":["Biological data; data ownership; data appropriation; benefit sharing; distributive justice","Citizens corporations."],"date":"2023-02-02T10:33:18.159035","doi":null,"subjects":["Philosophy","Arts and Humanities","Ethics and Political Philosophy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5qjpt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/5qjpt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/5qjpt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5qjpt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_204"}

Specifically, women report family responsibilities as the main reason not to enrol in adult education (AE). This paper examines how family life influences enrolment in formal AE differently between men and women in two societies with high\nenrolment rates; Finland and Great Britain. Data from Finnish registers and Understanding Society is used to derive empirical evidence on the multidimensional work-family-education nexus. The results demonstrate clearly that family responsibilities restrict women from participating in formal adult\neducation to a higher extent than men in Great Britain, but the picture is less gendered in Finland. Further, while Finnish society enables individuals who traditionally have fewer resources to attend formal AE (single parents, larger families), adult education in Britain is mainly taken up by individuals without children or by those in stable family situations. The results indicate the importance of institutional differences in providing equal access to further educational qualifications.","tags":["formal adult education","family life","gender inequality","comparative research"],"date":"2023-02-02T11:15:00.465656","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sex and Gender","Population","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology of Education","Children and Youth","Family"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5p8u2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/5p8u2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/5p8u2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5p8u2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_205"}

When and how food production started in the region is essentially not solved yet.\n\nStudies suggest that the introduction of food production dates back to the 1st millennium BCE. However, empirical data are sparsely available, and Central African research is still marked significantly by its lack of physical evidence. Postcolonial archaeological research started earlier in other parts of Central Africa, while the Congo Basin saw large-scale, systematic research on its prehistory from the late 1970s. Investigations focused predominantly on the chrono-typological sequences, as ceramics are an easily encountered find category in the region. Archaeobotanical samples often underwent no further scrutiny or are still awaiting processing. Political instability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1990s and 2000s halted research in the Congo Basin. The western parts of Central Africa are among the better-researched areas. However, even there, only limited evidence of early food production has been uncovered. For a more concise picture, one should nonetheless discuss these two bodies of evidence in conjunction.\n\nThe available evidence suggests that during the 1st millennium BCE, pearl millet, originating from West Africa, was used in southern Cameroon and the Congo Basin, but presumably not in quantities that constituted a staple crop. The evidence for the use of cooking bananas is incomplete. Archaeobotanical remains are dominated by charred oil palm or wild Canarium, both equally unsuited as a staple food. Thus, the composition of the subsistence base and the reliance on food production of the ceramic-producing communities living in the Congo Basin during the 1st millennium BCE and the 1st millennium CE remain uncertain.","tags":["Congo Rainforest","Archaeobotany","Archaeology","Food Production","Subsistence","Central Africa","Archaeozoology"],"date":"2023-02-02T13:43:10.301900","doi":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190277734.013.1226","subjects":["History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology","Arts and Humanities","Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gpz5e\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gpz5e\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gpz5e","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gpz5e","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190277734.013.1226","dataset_id":"socarxiv_206"}

After independence a new socio-political horizon based on complex social relations emerged, replacing the older notion of rigid stratification through overlapping potentialities and horizontal mobility among the lower stratum of social stratification. This translated into the formation of certain cohesive caste associations who ushered themselves into wider political representation and projected their identities while truncating the notion of purity and pollution. Politicians, in order to attract these associations towards themselves and gain their allegiances, used coercion to consolidate their position inside the electoral picture. Seizing this opportunity, those associations negotiated certain demands of their own with those in the political helm in return for a successful political mobilization. This article intends to understand the backgrounds and factors involved in the origin and formation of such associations who modulates the overall ideologies of the member groups, while cementing the path for a wider scale of identity politics.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-02T15:10:48.971313","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Anthropology","Population","Political Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Comparative Politics","Social and Cultural Anthropology","Political Science","Racial and Ethnic Minorities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6uw9m\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/6uw9m\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/6uw9m","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6uw9m","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_207"}

Our main goal was to determine the impact of e-tandems on language learner motivation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all courses at these two institutions were offered online, a move that greatly complicated the use of interactive group activities. This change represented a major threat to learner motivation and the development of communication skills in the target language. To counteract these effects, language teachers from the two universities organized an online e-tandem program; pairs of students composed of one American learner of French and one French learner of English had three virtual meetings to complete activities relevant to their studies. During these meetings, they were to alternate between speaking English and French. Following each exchange, students completed journal entries about their experience using the target language. Results indicated that the e-tandem program was a positive experience for students, with many reporting higher levels of intended learning effort and being able to see themselves as competent language users. These findings highlight the didactic potential of virtual exchanges.","tags":["foreign language classrooms","e-tandems","online exchange","languages for specific purposes","motivation","speaking skills"],"date":"2023-02-02T22:42:36.504275","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.1","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c5d8q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/c5d8q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/c5d8q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c5d8q","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.1","dataset_id":"socarxiv_209"}

This influence is inevitable on languages of the world. Distant contact has proved to introduce interesting language contact phenomena just like direct contact does. The present paper investigated Corona-related lexis in the spoken language of Arabic-broadcasting media, namely Aljazeera and A3 (an Algerian public channel). The significance of the study lies in showing the extent to which such media can influence Standard Arabic and how journalists can be important language agents. The question guiding the research is to circle the main linguistic process(es) adopted by journalists when they are faced with a situation which calls for immediate lexical modernization to name new concepts or objects. The research built on a descriptive discourse analysis method within the language-in-use approach for studying a corpus of 9314 utterances. It was found that media plays a role of prime importance in the diffusion of new vocabulary. Such diffusion remains uncontrolled by linguistic bodies, and therefore the linguists\u2019 role is, to a certain extent, divorced. It was found that the media language builds on borrowings, manifested in different types. Semantic expansion of already existing Arabic words was less attested. Coinage was found to be the least adopted method to introduce new items to name novel objects and concepts. Also, a point of prime significance is that English remains the main lending language on which Standard Arabic depends in the modernization of its dictionary. It was reported that some of the core borrowings of English origin are diffused even in the Maghreb region (namely Algeria) where French used to be a dominant foreign language.","tags":["modernization","media","Covid-19","linguistic purism","semantic expansion","Arabic","borrowing"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:17:14.867660","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.7","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sbe95\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/sbe95\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/sbe95","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sbe95","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.7","dataset_id":"socarxiv_215"}

Because there are not many studies assessing or how to assess university EFL students\u2019 intercultural competence in Algeria, it is necessary to research how much intercultural competence is incorporated into the current university English education program. Thus, the main question addressed is whether Algerian undergraduate EFL students have intercultural competence. To address this question, 36 third-year English major students at the Ibn Khaldoun University of Tiaret were randomly chosen to participate in the study. The measurement tool was a questionnaire with inquiries regarding the following three intercultural competence dimensions: attitudes, knowledge and skills. The findings of this study showed that although the participants\u2019 intercultural attitudes and knowledge are high, they lack the intercultural skills that are essential for attentive intercultural speakers to interpret and use appropriate expressions associated with the cultural environment.

In fact, online exchanges provide an excellent opportunity to enhance learners\u2019 analytical and critical thinking skills. They can enormously help develop learners\u2019 intercultural awareness making them ready to accept cultural differences. This paper examines the relevance of using virtual or online exchange development in language teaching and learning, focusing principally on virtual task categories and the use of Information Communication Technologies, which has become an everyday reality of the 21st century. It seeks to answer the following research questions: Do online exchanges help to develop learners\u2019 intercultural communicative competence? Are online communication tools effective for promoting the teaching and learning processes? A student\u2019s questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with teachers are adopted as instruments to collect the necessary data.

{"osf_id":"6jbxr","title":"Social Networks and Language Applications, Other Means of Learning? Students of English at Tlemcen University","description":"In recent times, at the turn of the 21st century, there have been significant developments in the use of technological advances for teaching languages. Following the use of traditional language laboratories, and then the emergence of computer-assisted forms of language teaching, language-oriented social networks such as YouTube and Facebook and other types of language applications have been used for that purpose, particularly in teaching English. Learners\u2019 attitudes are aroused in significantly different ways compared to feelings about traditional forms of language teaching, including learner-centered approaches. One aim of this paper is to elicit learners\u2019 interest in Internet use and to consider the degree to which social media and language applications  enhance in-class formal learning. This study brings forth learners\u2019 digital experience in the use of social media and we argue that it will raise awareness as to the importance of these media in improving their language skills. We thus attempt to explore the extent to which language learners benefit from their out-of-class Internet use. A small-scale survey, based on an online questionnaire addressed to Algerian students of English at Tlemcen University, reveals increasing interest in using such applications and social networks outside the class and their positive attitudes towards English in virtual spaces, particularly when having the possibility of discussing with native speakers. The results also show that communicating with others allows them to share intercultural aspects and mutual understanding. Indeed, respondents\u2019 positive attitudes towards mixed-culture conversation are attention-grabbing and significantly encouraging. However, it is believed that such informal, non-systematic methods of teaching\/ learning a foreign language can only complement formal teaching in class with non-virtual teachers.","tags":["Language applications","Online learning","English as a Foreign Language","Social media"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:36:43.827783","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.13","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6jbxr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/6jbxr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/6jbxr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6jbxr","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.13","dataset_id":"socarxiv_220"}

Currently, certain mass media announce alarming reports of plagiarism within research-based issuings, comprising information usage by renowned researchers. The occurrence scale of plagiarism has been divulged in diverse inquiries and grows dissimilar in different spheres, nations, instructive extents, and eras. Effective prevention by employing appropriate directives at a convenient time, the proper communications between instructors and learners, and working out practical strategies, for this purpose, are attainable methods of undertaking plagiarism.","tags":["plagiarism","Aspects","notions","keys","copyright breach"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:39:33.124184","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.14","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xps2u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/xps2u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/xps2u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xps2u","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.14","dataset_id":"socarxiv_221"}

However, there is a biased research focus on the role of CT skills, and empirical evidence on the relationships between CT disposition and foreign language learning is scant. This cross-sectional study aimed to bridge this gap by examining the effects of overall CT disposition as well as its sub-constructs (open-mindedness, perseverance, reflectiveness, inquisitiveness, and self-confidence) on foreign language proficiency. The study mainly discussed the research questions of how CT disposition was related to and to what extent it could predict learners\u2019 foreign language proficiency. This research employed Pearson correlation analysis, regression analysis, and one-way ANOVA to analyze the data collected from a sample of 391 Chinese foreign language learners at Jiangxi Normal University and Zaozhuang University. The instrument adopted to assess the participants\u2019 CT disposition was newly proposed in Chinese in the current study. The results demonstrated that both overall and sub-constructs of CT disposition were positively related to learners\u2019 foreign language proficiency. Foreign language learners embracing different levels of CT disposition displayed significant differences in their foreign language proficiency. Except for perseverance, the other four dispositional traits (open-mindedness, reflectiveness, inquisitiveness, and self-confidence) toward CT were found to be significantly positive predictors of learners\u2019 foreign language proficiency in the Chinese context. The positive impacts of CT disposition triggered in foreign language learning in the present research give an empirical grounding to the cultivation of foreign language learners\u2019 CT dispositional factors to facilitate their foreign language development. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future exploration and research were also discussed.","tags":["Chinese EFL learners","scale","foreign language proficiency","language achievement","relationship","Critical thinking disposition"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:41:52.060354","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.15","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jv7zw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/jv7zw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/jv7zw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jv7zw","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.15","dataset_id":"socarxiv_222"}

Therefore, teachers started to use and adopt modern techniques in education, mainly because of the pandemic of covid-19and, thus making the teaching process safe and effective. The current study aims to investigate students\u2019 perceptions of using Facebook to enhance their learning during an acute crisis. The main questions that established the research work are what are the students\u2019 perceptions of using Facebook to enhance their learning? What are the benefits of Facebook during the pandemic of covid-19? To answer these questions, the researcher conducted a case study of 2nd year English as Foreign Language students in the English Department at Tlemcen University, Algeria. The researcher used two research instruments to collect data; a questionnaire addressed to the students and a structured interview administered to the English teachers. Findings revealed that Facebook adoption has a significant positive relationship with usefulness and ease of use; there was also a considerable influence of Facebook adoption on educational usage. Additionally, both teachers and students stated that Facebook could improve students\u2019 academic   performance, and recognized its importance during this crisis period in making teaching and learning more accessible and productive. Based on the findings, the researcher made some recommendations about using Facebook in education, and future research can deal with more communities.","tags":["Facebook","English language usage","Covid-19","technological devices","teaching","learning"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:45:50.386519","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.16","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/af53b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/af53b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/af53b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/af53b","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.16","dataset_id":"socarxiv_223"}
{"osf_id":"25wsc","title":"The Impact of Social Media on Literature","description":"Literature is one of society\u2019s broad and significant elements because it shows how people interact and socialize. The objective of literature is education and entertainment through songs, poems, stories, and drama. However, a challenge that limits production and access to literary content is media. Traditionally, media used to convey literature material, such as books, television, radio, and theatres were limited to people who could afford or access venues. Consequently, the spread of literary content was limited to specific areas. However, media and information technology advancement has created a paradigm shift in the production and dissemination of literary content. This research evaluated the effects of media advancement in enhancing literature\u2019s production, dissemination, and consumption. Importantly, this research will explain the types of media technology and how they affect literature. Literature has experienced changes because media provides advanced methods of producing and disseminating literary content. There is a significant difference between literature produced during the Elizabethan era and the industrialization period and those produced in the digital age. Writing technology was the earliest approach to generating literature, and this has evolved into digital technology that generates audio-visual content. Media has also influenced the globalization of literature by enabling access to literary works across countries and cultures. Media technology has simplified the production of literature and provided digital channels for showcasing literary work, making digital a significant contributor to social and economic development. Media development has supported advancement in literature.","tags":["Literature","Social Media","Media Theory","Digital Content","Evolution of Literature"],"date":"2023-02-03T01:55:55.067354","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.18","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/25wsc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/25wsc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/25wsc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/25wsc","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.18","dataset_id":"socarxiv_224"}

This research espouses this belief and its basic significance is to show that a teacher imparting knowledge to a group of learners will remain an integral ingredient in formal teaching despite the unprecedented impact of technology on the sphere of education.  The major research question in this work intends to contrast two different English as foreign language (EFL) learning situations in Licence\/ Master\/ Doctorate (LMD) environment: one based on the internet and the other on a learning assisted by a teacher. This digest looks at the implications of both learning models and pores over the changes that teachers may encounter within their classes as digital technology penetrates every area of the nation\u2019s life. To comprehensively examine the predicted effects of both learning cases, the data have been amassed both quantitatively and qualitatively through a triangular approach using a questionnaire administered to students, interviews conducted with learners, classroom observation procedures, and evaluation of the learners\u2019 exams.

{"osf_id":"d2pwj","title":"Negotiating Identity through Multimodal Meaning Making: Investigation of Investment, Imagination and Choice in a Virtual Saudi EFL Context","description":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions worldwide were forced to rely on online platforms, whereby teaching was remotely undertaken. Although these platforms were gradually replaced by or supported with traditional, face-to-face methods as the pandemic came under control, this reliance on online platforms had a deep impact on different aspects of education in general and language education in specific. Examination of learners\u2019 engagement with literacy and the impact of learners\u2019 experiences on their identity construction represent some of the growing research interests in language education. The present study adopts a qualitative case-study approach, using interview, artefact collection, student-authored reflections and observational fieldnotes. The study aims to explore the literacy practices and identity construction and negotiation that underlies how a first-year female undergraduate engages with individual and group presentations in a mixed-level, English as a foreign language (EFL) course at a Saudi university. The study pays special attention to how the learner constructs and negotiates her identity in relation to multimodal meaning making which helps her to move beyond the limitations imposed by weak linguistic skills to negotiate more powerful identity positions associated with her investment in the event and the imagined community she aspires to join. The findings highlight the need to reconsider how learners\u2019 multimodal meaning making in language classes should be approached and assessed and how it can empower language learners and encourage them to adopt more powerful identity positions to sustain their language learning trajectories.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-03T02:01:31.089145","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.20","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/d2pwj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/d2pwj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/d2pwj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/d2pwj","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.20","dataset_id":"socarxiv_226"}

It draws on online ethnographic observation of Saudi Ph.D. sojourners in the U.K. on Twitter, one of the most popular social media platforms, from May 2019 to January 2020, followed by Twitter interviews. Social media platforms have become part and parcel of the daily lives of many people. For international students, such platforms are perhaps even more essential as they are used for educational and social purposes, as well as staying in contact with family and friends at home. The study addresses three questions examining the identities Saudi Ph.D. students construct on Twitter and how and when. Previous studies of international students have focused mainly on the pedagogical use of technology or intercultural competence. This research explores how, when, and why the participants constructed and developed their different identities on Twitter. Thematic analysis of the data was employed, informed by the grounded theory approach. The findings showed that the development of identities on Twitter is complex. The participants constructed various identities comprising many dimensions and involving complex perceptions of capital, power, and social identity. The construction of their identities entailed idioms of practice, using linguistic and non-linguistic cues, and forming communities of practice through audience design.","tags":["Saudi Ph.D. students","international","Ethnographic study","sojourners","social media","dentity"],"date":"2023-02-03T02:04:15.753824","doi":"10.24093\/awej\/comm1.21","subjects":["Arts and Humanities","English Language and Literature"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tjrm7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/tjrm7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/tjrm7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tjrm7","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24093\/awej\/comm1.21","dataset_id":"socarxiv_227"}

Challenges of Teaching English in the Post-Covid-19 Pandemic in Kuwait","description":"The migration from the traditional teaching method to online learning has affected both learners and educators at all levels. In Kuwait, this switch is implemented during three semesters. In this paper, we examine the challenges that Teachers of the English Language face today in Kuwait Post COVID-19. After the temporary on-learning that lasted three semesters, the current study investigates the impact of English language skills on school learners. The survey of the current study consisted of a total of 58 English female government secondary school teachers. While other studies have focused on the challenges that learners faced during this pandemic, this study chiefly concentrates on government teachers. The significance of this paper is to provide remedial plans to respond better to emergencies. The main question of this study is \u2018What are the challenges that governmental ESL teachers faced during the pandemic? And what are the remedial plans that could be implemented? To answer these questions,  a mixed methodology is used to achieve the research goal in which data are collected through an open-ended questionnaire and by interviewing three randomly selected participants. Teachers\u2019questionnaire (closed-ended) and semi-structured narrative interviews revealed that COVID-19 has a positive and negative impact on English language skills. The effects of online English language learning on secondary school students in Kuwait result in a poor level of proficiency that teachers would need to improve.

To explore how network structures influence not only population-level innovation but also performance among individuals, we studied an agent-based model of the Potions Task, a paradigm developed to test how structure affects a group's ability to solve a difficult exploration task. We explore how size, connectivity, and rates of information sharing in a network influence innovation and how these have an impact on the emergence of inequality in terms of agent contributions. We find, in line with prior work, population size has a positive effect on innovation, but also find that large and small populations perform similarly; that many small groups outperform fewer large groups; that random changes to structure have few effects on innovation in the task; and that the highest performing agents tend to occupy more central positions in the network. Moreover, we show that every network factor which improves innovation leads to a proportional increase in inequality of performance in the network, creating \"genius effects\" among otherwise \"dumb\" agents in both idealized and real-world networks.","tags":["Cultural evolution","Networks","Innovation","Collective intelligence","Inequality","Collective problem-solving"],"date":"2023-02-03T23:54:18.056435","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n3hc6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/n3hc6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/n3hc6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n3hc6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_234"}

{"osf_id":"sqwb2","title":"A Bayesian cohort model for estimating out-of-school rates and populations","description":"The out-of-school rate is a critical indicator for monitoring global progress towards universal education. It quantifies the population of children and youth excluded from each level of the education system. As with many education indicators, historical out-of-school reporting has relied exclusively on imperfect administrative data. Recently, the education community has turned to survey data as a supplement to administrative data to overcome its gaps and weaknesses. Producing such consolidated estimates globally in the out-of-school rate context, however, is a challenging task due to the diversity in enrolment patterns, systematic differences in the nature and reliability of administrative and survey-based data, and the heavy presence of invalid administrative observations resulting from enrolment counts that exceed corresponding population estimates. In this paper we introduce a cohort-based Bayesian hierarchical model to address these challenges and produce complete time series of out-of-school rates for 192 countries. The model uses a flexible spline-based process for underlying cohort out-of-school rate curves that are smoothed through cohort progression and over time. Observations are related to these values using a dual likelihood setup where each data source has distinct bias and variance components. The administrative side includes a structure that propagates uncertainty information contained in invalid data to avoid understating uncertainty. Validation exercises and sensitivity analysis suggest that the model is reasonably well calibrated and offers a material improvement over simpler approaches. The model is currently used by UNESCO to monitor out-of-school rates for all countries with available data.","tags":["out-of-school rate","SDG 4","household surveys","Bayesian modelling","administrative data","cohorts"],"date":"2023-02-05T18:48:13.637220","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Statistics","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","International and Comparative Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sqwb2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/sqwb2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/sqwb2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sqwb2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_236"}

I believe that, while it is true that the two constitutions are superficially similar in some aspects, they are the products of two very different political cultures and that such similarities are overdrawn.","tags":["Political history","Russia","Constitutional history","France"],"date":"2023-02-05T19:11:06.247100","doi":null,"subjects":["European History","History","Arts and Humanities","Political History"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ghmbk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ghmbk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ghmbk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ghmbk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_237"}
{"osf_id":"r8ygd","title":"Measuring Cybercrime and Cyberdeviance in Surveys","description":"Cybercrime is on the rise, and so is the need to systematically analyze its prevalence, distribution, causes, and consequences. While official records (mainly police, prosecution and court statistics) provide important information to explore online crime, they have been subject to extensive criticism due to the presence of measurement error arising from the combined influences of victims\u2019 underreporting and recording practices. Consequently, researchers, crime analysts and policy makers are increasingly relying on estimates of cybercrime and cyberdeviance based on surveys. This chapter reviews the measures of cybercrime and cyberdeviance included in national crime surveys, including household and business victimization surveys and self-report offending surveys. The chapter describes, categorizes and compares measures included in surveys, and discusses opportunities and limitations to generate reliable and valid estimates to study cybercrime and cyberdeviance. Measures included in surveys do not capture the diversity of criminal and deviant behaviors that take place online, and some surveys only probe about certain frauds that may take place both on and offline. The chapter identifies opportunities for researchers to utilize existing data to advance our understanding of online victimization and offending, and provides methodological recommendations to improve the recording of cybercrime and cyberdeviance in existing surveys.","tags":["Cybercrime","Cyberdeviance","Measurement","Survey"],"date":"2023-02-05T21:18:51.291485","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Statistics","Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r8ygd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/r8ygd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/r8ygd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r8ygd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_238"}
{"osf_id":"u8zcx","title":"Why we struggle to realise the value of data","description":"Governments and businesses are under pressure to realise the value of data, yet value realisation is often elusive. This paper examines the origins and logics of the discourses that underpin the drive to invest in data and analytics. It finds that a linear-mechanic  logic scaffolds the ideas drawn from public administration theory, economics, and theories of data and evidence use that permeate government, business, and academic framings. However, within the critique of these ideas, another pattern emerges. The view that simple metrics and universal solutions should guide and evaluate the actions of centralised, hierarchical decision makers competes with an alternative perspective. Value creation and its consumption are increasingly seen as a collective and complex endeavour. Yet we lack theories of value to support this approach. In response, this paper proposes that a new theory of value is required if we are to understand and articulate what collective value looks like and how to create it. Subsequent papers propose that new theory.","tags":["government","value creation","public administration","value","Big Data","complexity"],"date":"2023-02-05T21:57:25.748944","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Administration","Public Policy","Arts and Humanities","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Science and Technology Policy","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Digital Humanities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u8zcx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/u8zcx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/u8zcx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u8zcx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_239"}

Three propositions to address this problem are offered, which are expanded upon in three subsequent working papers. The first proposition is that value is the expanded capacity to act (i.e. power) that we seek from all social investments. The second proposition differentiates collective value creation from value extraction. Power-with is where the value produced from social investments is shared (value sharing). Power-over is where value is hoarded (value extraction). The third proposition is that only a power-with (value sharing) leads to long-term collective virtuous cycles of value creation. Examples are provided of what this looks like in practice indicating the key features of a power-with. In contrast, value extraction risks and undermines value creation by eroding trust, reducing effective feedback, reducing collective members\u2019 capacity to contribute, and can lead to passive withdrawal from value creation arrangements or their active resistance. The authority and legitimacy of society\u2019s agents (e.g. elected officials, public administrators, corporate executives) rests on their facilitation of collective value creation and its dispersal, and on protecting the collective from value extraction.","tags":["value creation","power-with","power","Deleuze and Guattari","value","assemblage"],"date":"2023-02-05T22:11:30.009428","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Administration","Arts and Humanities","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Continental Philosophy","Science and Technology Policy","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Digital Humanities","Philosophy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3pheu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/3pheu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/3pheu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3pheu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_240"}

Mapped over Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s theory of desiring production, value becomes enhanced capacity to act (or power) and the desire for value creates our entire social world. We enter social relationships\u2014friendships, families, organisations, nation-states, etc\u2014to enhance our capacity to act. In the process, we create desiring machines or assemblages which are temporary collections of things (people, objects, ideas, etc) arranged to create and disperse value for its participants. These assemblages adhere and are legitimate where they produce value for all their contributors and risk dissolution and harm where they disempower and extract value (i.e. illegitimate desiring-production). An inverse metaphysics to traditional Western thought is required in which, firstly, things are motivated internally rather than externally such as by universal laws or truths, and secondly, existence is inherently dynamic rather than static.

Power-to and power-with emerged in separate dichotomous debates to oppose domination (power-over), the traditional focus of power theory. Efforts to combine power-to, power-over, and power-with into a trichotomy, rather than producing a clear and robust positive theory of power to challenge domination, have created a complex and contested mix of definitions. This paper proposes a simplified formulation of the trichotomy: power at its most fundamental is the capacity to act and achieve outcomes and is labelled power-to. Power-over and power-with become two opposing exercises of this capacity. Power-over retains its emphasis on the hoarding of value by the dominant (normatively negative).  Power-with is redefined to refer to an exercise of power in which value is equitably shared (normatively positive). These new definitions require that we abandon some of the distinguishing features that have been attached to these terms, but doing so resolves some outstanding disputes and provides new opportunities. It opens the way to more effectively ask what power-with and the conditions for collective flourishing and value creation might look like and why we should choose them over domination.","tags":["power-with","power-trichotomy","power","power-over","power-to"],"date":"2023-02-05T22:23:44.633273","doi":null,"subjects":["Arts and Humanities","Continental Philosophy","Political Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Political Science","Philosophy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v8qh9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/v8qh9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/v8qh9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v8qh9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_242"}

{"osf_id":"uf5dh","title":"Disrupting the governance of social-ecological rigidity traps: Can pluralism foster change towards sustainability?","description":"Processes of change towards sustainability are urgently needed to ensure that humans continue to live within safe biophysical limits. Governance and politics are inherently implicated in any effort to foster successful change processes. Pluralism has been argued as a key ingredient for increasing the likelihood of robust and viable processes of change. Here, we explore pluralism vis-a-vis resource and ecosystem governance from a social-ecological systems (SES) perspective, considering both plurality of values and methodological pluralism. We focus on (1) understanding situations of limited pluralism and factors contributing to it being perpetuated, and (2) exploring how \u201clatent pluralism\u201d could be drawn out to foster change towards sustainability. Our particular interest lies in understanding the role of discursive-institutional dynamics\u2014discourses and how they play out via institutions\u2014underlying governance. To these ends, we synthesize and build on existing case study research in the Do\u00f1ana region (Guadalquivir estuary, SW Spain), an estuary-delta SES characterized by a rigidity trap, a situation of inflexibility that makes the SES more vulnerable. Using the illustrative example of a failed hydraulic megaproject, we use a novel analytical approach blending institutional analysis with discursive-institutional dynamics. We show how tight relationships between institutional structures and dominant discourses in the Do\u00f1ana region, underpinned by a hegemonic hydraulic-mission discourse, played a prominent role in curtailing pluralism in Do\u00f1ana's governance contexts over time. We also show how latent pluralism exists in the region, and reflect upon current ideas and discourses that might help loosen existing governance stalemates and foster change towards sustainability.","tags":["discourse inertia","sustainability","command-and-control","hydraulic mission discourse","SES traps","pluralism","Neoinstitutionalism"],"date":"2023-02-06T17:19:04.164809","doi":"10.1016\/bs.aecr.2022.04.011","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/uf5dh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/uf5dh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/uf5dh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/uf5dh","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/bs.aecr.2022.04.011","dataset_id":"socarxiv_244"}
{"osf_id":"dp849","title":"Reporting on scientific studies in newspaper articles on COVID-19 in Italy and the US: missing citations and information bubbles","description":"Newspapers are a major source of health information, including on COVID-19. Many news articles are based on press releases describing research published in scientific journals. We studied a sample of articles in US and Italian newspapers for their mention of non-pharmacological interventions (face masks and lockdown) and pharmacological ones, both effective and ineffective (convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, vaccines and vitamin D), and whether these were mentioned in a favorable or unfavorable way. We checked for the presence or absence of explicit mentions or links of the primary source of scientific information. Finally, we analyzed whether there was a trend to form \u201cinformation bubbles\u201d where some opinions around different treatments cluster together.\nOf 480,819 news in the USA and 767,172 in Italy, vaccines, face masks and lockdown were the most mentioned interventions. Of the pharmacological interventions other than vaccines, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were more frequently mentioned in the USA than in Italy (5- and 6-fold, respectively) although, when analyzing a sample of 210 news returned from a search on COVID-19 mentioning a research publication, articles from the USA were less favorable than those in Italy. We also found that the frequency of articles with a negative stance on vaccines was very small, indicating that the main newspapers do not contribute significantly to vaccine hesitancy. There was also evidence of information bubbles, where articles with a favorable or unfavorable view of a non-approved drug had the same stance on other non-approved treatments.\nOf the 210 news articles analyzed, half specifically mentioned a scientific publication. However, a link (or a complete citation) to the original source was provided in only 16% of Italian newspapers as opposed to 58% of those in the USA. The results highlight the fact that often news stories do not cite the scientific article they are reporting on, thus allowing the reader to verify the original source. This weakness in the citation behavior is particularly evident in Italian newspapers. This study suggests that linking to the original research article, rather than basing the news story on a press release, would improve the trustworthiness of the news and the critical thinking in the reader.","tags":["Misinformation","Public health","COVID-19","Health information","Health communication","Information quality","Newspapers"],"date":"2023-02-07T10:00:33.596096","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Communication","Communication"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dp849\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/dp849\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/dp849","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dp849","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_245"}

In pursuing such new partnerships, firms must contend with many unforeseen and ill-defined risks, which arise from conflicting stakeholder agendas and needs, organisational barriers, and other challenges of open innovation. Practitioners and scholars alike have responded by developing conceptual frameworks of stakeholder engagement. However, there is still a lack of research on the design activities, mechanisms, and digital platforms to promote stakeholder engagement in open innovation. To address this gap, our study employs the Action Design Research methodology to develop design principles for digital platforms and organisational mechanisms that promote stakeholder engagement in open innovation. The research question is: \"How should a digital platform be designed to enable engagement among various stakeholders in open innovation?\" An initial set of five design principles was developed based on an open innovation process framework and contingency theory.

As a result, actors responding to effects from distal fields may nevertheless collide over the objects and settings in which they are compelled to act.","tags":["materiality","culture","fields","change","cognition"],"date":"2023-02-09T18:57:32.264283","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ywp7z\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ywp7z\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ywp7z","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ywp7z","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_253"}

{"osf_id":"qn629","title":"Dark Side of the Principles of Non-discrimination and Proportionality: the Case of Mandatory Vaccination","description":"Deciding the conflict between various rights and interests, especially in medical ethics where health and lives are in question, has significant challenges, and to obtain appropriate outcomes, it is necessary to properly apply the principles of non-discrimination and proportionality. Using the example of mandatory vaccination policies, we show that this task becomes even more difficult when these principles lead us to counterintuitive and paradoxical results. Although the general purpose of these principles is to ensure that decisions and policies seek the highest and broadest possible enjoyment of rights for all (i.e., the least restrictive solution), they achieve the complete opposite when applied to mandatory vaccination policies. To highlight and explain these paradoxical results, we present a typology of fifteen hypothetical mandatory vaccination policies containing various degrees of restriction and apply well-established non-discrimination and proportionality tests from constitutional law to each. We argue that mandatory vaccination policies exhibit two characteristics, namely the non-linear relationship between their general purposes and specific goals and the involvement of life and health, suggesting that more restrictive policies should prevail even though less restrictive policies might fail these tests. Using clearly structured and rigorous methodology from constitutional law, the proposed approach delivers a fresh view on the core ethical principles of non-discrimination and proportionality and a potentially useful tool in helping resolve also other challenges encountered in medical ethics beyond mandatory vaccination policies","tags":["vaccination policy","non-discrimination","proportionality","mandatory vaccination"],"date":"2023-02-10T11:07:55.408689","doi":"10.1136\/jme-2023-108998","subjects":["Medical Jurisprudence","Law","Health Law and Policy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qn629\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/qn629\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/qn629","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qn629","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/jme-2023-108998","dataset_id":"socarxiv_256"}
{"osf_id":"g8yv2","title":"Inequality and socio-economic divides in parental transfers to young adults in the United States","description":"Parental transfers of money and co-residence to young-adult children can serve as means of status reproduction. Yet, the relationship between inequality and socio-economic gaps in these forms of parental support has not been studied. Inequality may widen socio-economic differentials in monetary and co-residential transfers, potentially hindering social mobility. I test the association between income inequality and socio-economic divides in parental support to children aged 22\u201335 in the United States (U.S.), a context where the economic dependence of young adults has increased over decades of high or rising inequality. I link state-level inequality data to longitudinal data on 39,626 parent-child dyads from the Health and Retirement Study (1992\u20132018). Using fixed-effects models I investigate how changes in income inequality within states relate to changes in wealth, income, and educational gradients in parental transfers over time. Socio-economic differences in the occurrence and amount of money transfers widen with inequality, as the probability of monetary support decreases among lower-class and lower-educated parents, while the amounts transferred increase among upper-class and higher-educated parents. Moreover, in times of higher inequality, co-residence is more strongly concentrated among lower-class, lower-educated parents. Previous research shows that receiving money improves labour and housing market outcomes, while co-residence may restrict economic opportunities among young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds. In light of this, my findings suggest that rising U.S. inequality may hinder social mobility by shifting the socio-economic distribution of intergenerational support.","tags":["Great Recession","Social mobility","Co-residence","intergenerational transfers"],"date":"2023-02-10T13:09:28.939757","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g8yv2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/g8yv2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/g8yv2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g8yv2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_257"}

Less clear, however, is how material wealth is associated with relational\nwealth, and the implications of such associations for material wealth inequality. Theory and evidence suggest that material wealth both guides, and is patterned by, relational wealth. While existing comparative studies typically assume complementarity between different types of wealth, such associations may differ for distinct kinds of relational wealth. Here, we first review the literature to identify how and why different forms of relational wealth may align. We then turn to an analysis of household-level social networks (food sharing, gender-specific friendship and gender-specific co-working networks) and material wealth data from a rural community in Pemba, Zanzibar. We find that (a) the materially wealthy have most relational ties, (b) the associations between relational and material wealth\u2014as well as relational wealth more generally\u2014are patterned by gender differences, and (c) different forms of relational wealth have similar structural properties and are closely aligned.

This research aims to show how Islamic feminism developed in Iran and discuss the philosophical and epistemological foundations of different discourses influencing that movement. This study utilizes documentary research methods. It shows that central to the development of Islamic feminism is the development of the reformist movement in Iran. Reformists believe that employing justice in Islamic laws requires a novel hermeneutic interpretation of sacred texts that account for absolute equality in men\u2019s and women\u2019s rights. However, traditional and neo-traditional jurists present different interpretations of the notion of justice regarding gender relations. They believe that since men and women have existential and inborn differences, they hold separate rights and duties, especially regarding their social and family roles. Accordingly, two kinds of law are needed to regulate their lives. Using reformist theories, Muslim feminists in Iran have challenged the traditional interpretation of sacred texts and called for women\u2019s rights as equal to men\u2019s in the Islamic constitution.","tags":["Iran","fiqh","reformist discourse","Islamic feminism","gender roles","women\u2019s rights","traditionalist discourse","reformist movement"],"date":"2023-02-10T17:21:52.120875","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sex and Gender","Human Rights","Sociology of Religion","Comparative and Historical Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Near and Middle Eastern Studies","Political Science","International and Area Studies","Other Political Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6rycu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/6rycu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/6rycu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6rycu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_259"}
{"osf_id":"9hqnp","title":"The Composition of Descriptive Representation","description":"How well do governments represent the societies they serve? A key aspect of this question concerns the extent to which leaders reflect the demographic features of the population they represent. To address this important issue in a systematic manner, we propose a unified approach for measuring descriptive representation. We apply this approach to newly collected data describing the ethnic, linguistic, religious, and gender identities of over 50,000 leaders serving in 1,552 political bodies across 156 countries. Strikingly, no country represents social groups in rough proportion to their share of the population. To explain this shortfall, we focus on compositional factors\u2014the size of political bodies as well as the number and relative size of social groups. We investigate these factors using a simple model based on random sampling and the original data described above. Our analyses demonstrate that roughly half of the variability in descriptive representation is attributable to compositional factors.

Scientists who are able to recognize and traverse skills gaps are better positioned to pursue impactful science and achieve their personal career goals. To bolster their skills, life scientists often turn to short-format training (e.g., workshops, bootcamps, and short courses) for professional development. While short-format training (SFT) provides point-of-need help, and is often low in time commitment and costs, this approach can be less successful than typically assumed. A diverse group of experts with experience relevant to instruction (short format and otherwise) in the life sciences met (December 2021\/May 2022) to formulate a set of 14 actionable recommendations to strengthen SFT, making it accessible and effective across the career span for life scientists. The conference attendees identified challenges, solutions, and both incentives to and barriers preventing the implementation of any of these recommendations. This document outlines a roadmap, with suggestions for the implementation of each recommendation by one of three stakeholder types (individuals, groups\/communities of practice, or organizations). Key differences in opportunities to implement, as well as in the likelihood of any next-step based on an initial implementation, arise from the types of outputs of implementation by stakeholders at grass roots (individuals, bottom-up), formal organizations (where policies might arise, top down), and informal organizations (groups and communities of practice, leading from the middle). These stakeholder groups are general and do not create a mutually exclusive nor exhaustive partitioning of actors in the global communities intending to strengthen SFT, but this Roadmap offers suggestions for implementation of the 14 recommendations by each of the three stakeholder types\/levels. We were able to identify concrete paths for each stakeholder level to implement each recommendation, and also consider which level might have the greatest success as the starting point for each recommendation.","tags":["roadmap","short-format training","higher education","career-spanning training","accessible training","life sciences training","inclusive training"],"date":"2023-02-11T05:17:06.269436","doi":null,"subjects":["Curriculum and Instruction","Adult and Continuing Education","Curriculum and Social Inquiry","Education","Higher Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7d2yx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/7d2yx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/7d2yx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7d2yx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_261"}
{"osf_id":"jqxb6","title":"Pygmalion Displacement: When Humanising AI Dehumanises Women","description":"We use the myth of Pygmalion as a lens to investigate and frame the relationship between women and artificial intelligence (AI). Pygmalion was a legendary ancient king of Cyprus and sculptor. Having been repulsed by women, he used his skills to create a statue, which was imbued with life by the goddess Aphrodite. This can be seen as one of the primordial AI-like myths, wherein humanity creates intelligent life-like self-images to reproduce or replace ourselves. In addition, the myth prefigures historical and present gendered dynamics within the field of AI and between AI and society at large. Throughout history, the theme of women being replaced by inanimate objects (e.g. automata, algorithms) has been repeated, and continues to repeat in contemporary AI technologies. However, this socially detrimental pattern in technology \u2014 what we dub Pygmalion displacement \u2014 is often overlooked, whether due to naive excitement about new developments, or due to an unacknowledged sexist history of the field itself. As we demonstrate herein, Pygmalion displacement prefigures heavily, but in an unacknowledged way, in the original Turing test, the imitation game: a central thought experiment, foundational to AI. With women, and the feminine generally, being both dislocated and erased from and by technology, AI is and has been (presented as) created mainly by privileged men, subserving capitalist patriarchal ends. This poses serious dangers to women and other marginalised people. By tracing the historical and ongoing entwinement of femininity (from a patriarchal perspective) and AI, we aim to understand, make visible, and start a dialogue on the ways in which AI harms women.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-11T11:37:13.862960","doi":null,"subjects":["Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","Psychology","Arts and Humanities","Science and Technology Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Theory and Philosophy","Women's Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jqxb6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/jqxb6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/jqxb6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jqxb6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_262"}
{"osf_id":"p92t4","title":"Methods for reporting online sexual harassment","description":"The rise of online sexual harassment in recent years has spurred discussions both within the European Union and internationally. To effectively address this issue, it is imperative to foster collaboration among various sectors, including government entities, nongovernmental organizations, educational institutions, media outlets, and technology companies. These sectors collectively develop and implement practical intervention strategies to systematically support individuals affected by online sexual harassment. Notably, social media platforms play a crucial role in addressing this issue. These platforms have implemented measures such as automated content detection and flagging systems, allowing users to report harmful content to moderators. Nevertheless, these measures, on their own, have been proven to be inadequate given the personalized nature of online harassment, which is influenced by factors such as culture, sex, gender, sexual orientation and, generally, the intersectionality of various systems of oppression. Hence, the development of effective user self-reporting systems is imperative. These systems should provide victims with immediate assistance during harassment incidents, promoting a safer online environment, while also enhancing user trust and overall platform satisfaction. The objective of this report is to provide decision-makers both from political bodies and from online platforms with preliminary evidence-based innovative ideas on how to improve the user self-reporting system on social media platforms. Testing the effectiveness of the proposed reporting systems is part of our ongoing research. The authors acknowledge the ongoing debate about the use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d as it may be interpreted to mean that those targeted are in a passive state of subjugation. The authors acknowledge also the growing advocacy, especially by members of the civil society, for the use of the word \u201csurvivor\u201d as it emphasizes the strength of the people targeted by sexual harassment. However, the authors also note the debated about how this emphasis on strength may burden the targeted community with the obligation to overcome such traumatic experiences. Hence, the utilization of the expression \u201cvictims\u201d in this report should be interpreted through this critical lens.","tags":["reporting system","law","online sexual harassment","social media"],"date":"2023-02-11T12:54:00.647629","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Law","Science and Technology Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/p92t4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/p92t4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/p92t4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/p92t4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_263"}

Negative teacher beliefs and expectations may contribute to low learning outcomes among the poor, especially if they are reflected in classroom practices and interactions. Studies from various Southern contexts have shown that students from poor and marginalized backgrounds are more likely to be subject to stereotypical and deficit-oriented teacher beliefs, but the evidence is scattered and disconnected. This study therefore systematically reviews the empirical literature on teacher beliefs and their implications for the educational outcomes of disadvantaged students in the global South. We primarily focus on studies using a qualitative sociological approach, to complement an existing review that looks on the quantitative and econometric literature. Based on the findings, we develop a conceptual framework that identifies the structural and cultural determinants of teacher beliefs and the various mechanisms that link them to diminished wellbeing and educational achievement for disadvantaged students. The 55 empirical studies included in our review poignantly illustrate the degree of injustice and discrimination inflicted on the children of the poor as they navigate education systems around the world. We also highlight examples of positive teacher beliefs and practices, however, and discuss promising avenues for further research.

The purpose of this study was to learn more about the socioeconomic context of dengue in Bangladesh, as well as the general public's knowledge, attitude, and behavior (KAP) toward the disease. In this short study, it has been observed that Masters pass participants had 13% lower practices compared to the Bachelor pass participants and employed participants had 3.69 times more practices compared to the unemployed participants. According to knowledge and attitude status, the chance of practicing the items towards dengue fever was more for knowledgeable persons [aOR: 3.00 (95% CI: 0.52, 17.37); p-value=0.221] and persons who had good attitude [aOR: 1.28 (95% CI: 0.30, 5.46); p-value=0.742].

Yet we know less about which policy issues citizens are more likely to prioritize over democratic norms. This is particularly important in European multiparty systems where issue-based voting has become salient. We hypothesize that socio-cultural issues are more likely to generate trade-offs between issue congruence and democratic principles than \u2018left-right\u2019 issues, and test this with evidence from a pre-registered conjoint experiment (n=2406) from Finland.

{"osf_id":"9qtzf","title":"Children &amp; the Chthulu: What child-authored books reveal about the Anthropocene","description":"This research sheds light on Indian children\u2019s process of meaning-making of the Anthropocene using place-ecological meaning. It explores how children creatively expressed their understanding of human and more-than-human under the Anthropocene in books they authored. The children\u2019s books were the primary source of data; additional data from creative writing responses, journals and interviews was elicited, and the analysed using thematic analysis. Results reveal that the children used their experiences with place-based nature to develop a strong place-ecological meaning, which inspired a striking critique of the necropolitical and geontopolitical regime of the Anthropocene. Children\u2019s own sense of marginalization in an adult world forged empathy with the more-than-human, children, and marginalized humans, countering the hegemonic narratives that drive the Anthropocene, and fostering a sense of collective activism and resistance. In the books, the more-than-human entities became agents rather than objects centred around humans, shaping an exchange and co-merging with children. The results of this research reinforce theoretical and empirical work on the process of place-ecological meaning with additional significance as a qualitative study that foregrounds the voices of children in the Global South and their meaning-making of the Anthropocene.  The study roots universal knowledge of the Anthropocene in familiar spaces using experiences, places and local ecologies. It recommends adding place-ecological meaning as a criterion for adjudging children\u2019s environmental literature. It also recommends revising the place-ecological meaning scale to include ways to assess meaning-making of the Anthropocene.","tags":["Anthropocene","Indian children","posthumanism","creativity","education","india","place-ecological meaning"],"date":"2023-02-13T09:52:00.740495","doi":null,"subjects":["Fiction","Arts and Humanities","Curriculum and Social Inquiry","Environmental Studies","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Creative Writing"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9qtzf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/9qtzf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/9qtzf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9qtzf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_273"}
{"osf_id":"s5nh7","title":"Co-creation of the Digital Democracy and Data Commons Manifesto: alternative sociotechnical visions of data","description":"Amidst public concern surrounding the proprietary and exploitative use of personal data by corporations and public institutions, and its consequences from a sociotechnical perspective, narratives around digital commons have recently emerged framing potential alternatives. This paper presents the results of an experimental approach, methodology and process, through which two main questions are addressed. First, how to articulate co-creation dynamics for the structured and participatory elaboration of the Digital Democracy and Data Commons Manifesto following openness, diversity and inclusivity principles. Second, how the manifesto, as a narrative and discursive artifact, can follow and conclude a wider process of sociotechnical discussion and positioning about data commons. Our approach is based on participatory design methods, more concretely on a collaborative writing sprint, to co-create a manifesto on alternatives to current datafication, digital inequalities and lack of citizen control over personal data. On the one hand we describe the process to implement a sprint approach for collaboratively writing a topic-specific manifesto, in the context of the broader EU project DECODE (Decentralized Citizen Owned Data Ecosystems). On the other hand, we present and analyze main results from the content structure of the manifesto over its initial and final versions, which moved progressively as a cohesive text away from a scholarly and policy-oriented tone.","tags":["writing sprint","co-creation","digital manifestos","data commons"],"date":"2023-02-13T10:54:31.653724","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s5nh7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/s5nh7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/s5nh7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s5nh7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_274"}

However, it is observed that nomothetic research evaluation practice by extending the application of evaluative bibliometrics prevalent in NS research evaluation is very much prevalent in SSH research assessment exercises. This paper tries to underline the differences in epistemic culture as well the structural orientation of knowledge activities between these two broad disciplines. Also, inadequacies and difficulties in the coverage of SSH research in citation databases are highlighted. Further, the utilities of alternative attempts to measure SSH research impact objectively have been discussed.

{"osf_id":"3y9u6","title":"Are we Safe? An Investigation on \u2018Eve-teasing\u2019 (or public sexual harassment) in India","description":"In recent years, many countries have tightened the rules against harassment at the workplace and violence in the home. On the other hand, the incidences of sexual harassment in public places have not been paid sufficient attention, specifically against women. Developing countries like India have recorded the increment of sexual harassment cases in public places due to the increment in participation of women in outside activities such as education and employment. In India, the term \u2018Eve-teasing\u2019 is a euphemism that is used for sexual harassment in public places. Eve-teasing is identified as a significant problem in the patriarchal society of India that causes dreadful implications on women. The daily encounter with sexual harassment leads to a decline in their career and also socio-economic and political opportunities for them. In recent years, these misdeeds have been spread at every corner of our society and have become a national problem. Eve-teasing is not considered atrocious and strong laws have not been enacted to counteract it. To this end, this study has been conducted to identify the socio-psychological repercussions of Eve-teasing on girl cadets of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) aged between 19 and 24 years. Moreover, the significance of NCC in empowering the girl cadets in dealing with daily harassment is also the focus of the investigation. Particularly, the structural feminist approach is adopted to offer a critical framework to examine the patriarchal socialization of men and women as the most common cause of Eve-teasing. A total of 262 women participated in this study. The data were collected at the national camp of NCC held in New Delhi through a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussions from January 18 to 29, 2020. Out of the total respondents, 83.20% were exposed to Eve-teasing in their lives, while 15.26% of them did not disclose about such incidents. The study concludes by highlighting the negative implications of Eve-teasing on the life of adolescent females and also with disclosing their suffering and struggle. Although, the respondents were the cadets of the National Cadet Corps (NCC), which helped them to shape self-confidence to fight against such sexual harassment acts. Therefore, it is suggested to the governments (state and central) to emphasize the involvement of the agencies having similar goals as NCC in empowering the females in the early years.","tags":["sexual harassment","fear","little rape","Eve-teasing","young female","women"],"date":"2023-02-13T11:59:39.314313","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sex and Gender","Human Rights","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Mental Health","Crime, Law, and Deviance","Children and Youth","Sexualities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3y9u6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/3y9u6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/3y9u6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3y9u6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_276"}

While the #DisruptJMM hashtag has been used since 2019, the vast majority of use was in the JMM 2020 meetings. Twitter hashtags are used by activists to push forward conversations, join communities around a single idea, and create change. In this article, we draw on frameworks from community building seen in other equity and inclusion advocacy hashtags such as #GirlsLikeUs (Jackson et al., 2018) to qualitatively code and analyze tweets which used the #DisruptJMM hashtag. This analysis gives us a glimpse into the evolving conversations on social justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in the mathematical community. We see an emergence of community around recentering humanity in mathematics. This community supported each other's efforts, reflected on who is represented, and amplified discussions of power and privilege with a particular emphasis on bringing visibility to colonialism and sexual harrassment.","tags":["dei","twitter","equity","mathematics","social justice","qualitative"],"date":"2023-02-13T18:12:53.340067","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Media","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Communication"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8cxm4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/8cxm4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/8cxm4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8cxm4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_278"}

Scientific evidence points to the association between exposure to tobacco advertisements and subsequent increases in tobacco use. Due to the health risks of tobacco use, especially for youth, tobacco advertising is among the most regulated types of advertising. Globally, empirical research found that comprehensive tobacco advertising bans can reduce tobacco consumption, whereas partial tobacco advertising bans will have little or no effect as manufacturers may turn to non-banned media formats of advertisements. Other factors such as transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, as well as electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) enabled by the Internet, social media, and mobile communication, also pose additional challenges to health communication programs in tobacco control and prevention.

This article develops an outline framework and reasoning for NFT and Blockchain technology to be used to establish provenance of digital artifacts in what is an increasingly contested digital space. A space where the subtle (and perhaps not so subtle) manipulation of video, images, and all forms of digital evidence and documents by humans, and increasingly artificial intelligence, could be used to challenge contemporary narratives and manipulate the past. This framework should be seen as an opening proposal to ignite discussion, as the establishment of any technology in this space should not be done without careful consideration.

{"osf_id":"w5qfj","title":"The Changing Meaning Of \u201cNo\u201d In Canadian Sex Work","description":"With the migration of sex workers to online advertising in Canada, a substantial body of research has emerged on how they communicate with prospective clients. However, given the enormous quantity of archival material available, finding representative ways to identify what sex workers say is a difficult task. Numerical analysis of commonly used phrases allows for the analysis of large numbers of documents potentially identifying themes that may be missed using other techniques. This study considers how Canadian sex workers communicate by examining how the word \u201cno\u201d was used by online advertisers over a 15-year period. Source materials consisted of three collections of online advertising containing over 4.2 million ads collected between 2007 and 2022 representing 214456 advertisers. Advertisers and demographic variables were extracted from ad metadata. Common terms surrounding the word \u201cno\u201d were used to identify themes. The word \u201cno\u201d was used by 115127 advertisers. Five major themes were identified: client reassurance (54084 advertisers), communication (47130 advertisers), client race (32612 advertisers), client behavior (23863 advertisers), and service restrictions (8545 advertisers). The probability of there being an association between an advertiser and a major theme was found to vary in response to several variables, including: time period, region, advertiser gender, and advertiser ethnicity. Results are compared with previous work on race and risk messaging in sex work advertising and factors influencing client race restrictions are considered.

According to the findings, STEM researchers self-archived pre\/post-print versions of their articles to subject-based repositories as a part of their discipline norm resulting from their funding grant requirements and as a way to receive recognition and claim priority. SSH researchers post a link to the printed-published article at the publisher\u2019s website in ASNs, and their goal is greater visibility. In addition, findings indicate a lack of awareness, mostly by SSH researchers, regarding copyright issues and OA repositories. The green OA model provides opportunities for researchers to self-archive their work. However, there are differences between the disciplines regarding where, when, why, and how to self-archive, and what is considered a legitimate mode of green OA.

ONS Longitudinal Study","description":"There is limited research on the longer-term impact of fostering on caregivers\u2019 own children. This study investigates whether the existing children in a fostering household differ from young people in non-caregiving households in the timing of their transitions to key adult roles, known to affect later health and life chances. Using data from the ONS Longitudinal Study, we pooled records from census years 1971 to 2001 and linked them to follow-up records from 1981 to 2011. We identified 2656 children living with a foster child and compared their profiles on the \u201cbig five\u201d transitions to roles of adulthood \u2014 finishing school; leaving home; finding work and becoming financially independent; getting married; and having children \u2014 with those of other children without a foster child in the household (N = 209,453). We fitted multiple exposure models that controlled for childhood sociodemographic confounders, with standard errors adjusted for clustering of records in childhood, to estimate the prevalence of the five roles measured in early adulthood. We found that achieving the transition to adulthood for caregivers\u2019 children was indicated based on four roles. The exception was leaving home. There was some evidence that caregivers\u2019 children might cope better with the transition to adulthood if they were older than the foster child or were female. The findings suggest that supporting foster parents with delaying their children\u2019s transition to adulthood could become part of the role of supervising social workers. Discussing with parents and their adolescent children what barriers might be preventing them from staying in school and what is prompting them to want to leave school and go out to work would be a first step, since educational qualifications have become so dominant for more recent generations of young people aspiring to take up other adult roles.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-15T10:25:36.215958","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Children and Youth"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qu5tn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/qu5tn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/qu5tn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qu5tn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_289"}
{"osf_id":"g38xc","title":"Technological Change and Preferences for Redistribution","description":"Technological change has fundamentally transformed the US labour market in recent decades, with high-earning jobs becoming increasingly focused on nonroutine, complex tasks. While existing research shows that inequalities are perceived as fairer and demand for redistribution is lower when incomes are earned through effort rather than luck, the nature of the effort tasks performed has received little attention. In this paper, we provide a first experimental test of whether fairness perceptions and preferences for redistribution differ when top earners gain their incomes through luck, routine work, or complex work. We find that the desired tax rate on top earners is up to 5.3 percentage points lower for the complex work treatment than the routine work treatment and that high incomes from complex work are perceived as fairer and more deserved. Interestingly, performance on complex tasks is also more likely to be seen as the result of inherited intelligence, suggesting that meritocratic preferences might prove inconsistent beyond the simple luck versus effort distinction. In an additional survey experiment, we find that higher earning individuals are perceived to have more complex jobs,\npointing to a novel explanation for falling top income tax rates in an era of rapidly rising top incomes shares.","tags":["technological change","inequality","fairness","redistribution"],"date":"2023-02-15T12:55:29.772331","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Economics","Political Economy","Public Economics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g38xc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/g38xc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/g38xc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g38xc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_290"}

The point of departure is that we need to distance ourselves from a simplified and reductive understanding of algorithms-as-objects, and care for them as part of a relational algorithmic assemblage. A simplified notion of algorithms is problematic for two reasons: First, as it produces a reductive notion of the world where decision makers point to algorithms-as-objects to make simplified decisions about the world. Second, by taking a simplified and delineated object called \u201calgorithm\u201d as the point of departure for analysis and critique in an algorithmic society, we risk producing technologically deterministic understandings of complex and composite problems. We illustrate this argument through two example drawn from the handling of Covid-19 pandemic, where we attend to a universalist mathematical epidemiology and the particularities of field epidemiology to problematize how we should care for, understand, and analyze algorithms in society.","tags":["models","actor-network theory","covid-19","assemblages","algorithms","epidemiology","care"],"date":"2023-02-15T13:03:21.231422","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Science, Knowledge, and Technology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rg7k6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/rg7k6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/rg7k6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rg7k6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_291"}

{"osf_id":"gmyjh","title":"Improving Subnational Opinion Estimation from Cluster-Sampled Polls","description":"The development of Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) has allowed scholars to more accurately estimate subnational public opinion using national polls. However, MRP generally fails to recover reliable estimates from polls whose respondents are selected using cluster sampling---also called area-probability sampling. This is in part because cluster-sampled polls rely on a complex form of random sampling focused on national representativeness that may result in small or unrepresentative subsamples in subnational geographies. This has limited MRP's usefulness in subnational opinion estimation in several contexts, including historical polls in the United States, where cluster-sampling was common into the 1980s, and large academic studies in many countries today. In this paper, I test two approaches to improve estimation from MRP with cluster-sampled polls. The first is pooling data from multiple surveys to produce a larger sample of clusters. The second is Clustered MRP (CMRP), which extends MRP by modeling opinion using the geographic information included in a survey's cluster-sampling procedure. Using simulations, I show that both methods improve upon traditional MRP, and I validate them using historical polls in the United States.","tags":["survey methods","hierarchical models","state politics","multilevel regression and poststratification","public opinion"],"date":"2023-02-15T22:25:48.103096","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Models and Methods","American Politics","Political Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gmyjh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gmyjh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gmyjh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gmyjh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_294"}

Here we provide a series of validation tests of the sort of cross-national time-series latent variable measures employed in recent research by reference to questions on support for liberal democracy and opposition to its erosion from multiwave surveys conducted around the world. These tests show that, across countries and years, this latent variable is nearly orthogonal to measures of support for contestation and participation; civil liberties; institutional constraints on executive power; and prioritizing democracy over the economy, economic equality, or order. We conclude that support for democracy in any robust sense is simply not well captured by a unidimensional latent variable.

The article aims to review the last 10 years (2010\u20132020) of remote working research publications (in Business and Management Studies). We used a bibliometric analysis of 1,996 publications from the Web of Science. We created a conceptual structure map to describe core concepts of remote working research. We used the historical direct citation network to show the most important research. Based on our results, the USA, the United Kingdom and China are the leading countries. Results identified two historical areas of research\u2014the first cluster connected by the topic of the multicultural dimension and the second cluster addressing issues of trust and communication, knowledge sharing, virtualness and leadership. The identified core concepts are organization and remote working capabilities, behaviour in remote working, consequences of remote working, management issues, home and gender. We conclude by summarizing the results of the bibliometric study into a theoretical framework for adaptation to remote working that will provide direction for future research and practical insights for policy and organizations.","tags":["Virtual team","Policy Makers","Bibliometrix","Work from Home","Human Resource Management","Teleworkers"],"date":"2023-02-17T13:56:58.148936","doi":"10.1177\/09722629221139064","subjects":["Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Organization Development","Leadership Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Library and Information Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kqd6r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/kqd6r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/kqd6r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kqd6r","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/09722629221139064","dataset_id":"socarxiv_304"}

Though much literature is available, they focus only on differences in airport spaces. The purpose of this study is to delve deeply into the lived experience of transgender women travellers by analysing social media content (YouTube) to discover the similarities and differences between the female transgender traveller and the cisgender traveller. The findings suggest that, like cisgender women, transgender women also fear sexual violence while travelling. Transgender women also love to engage in cultural activities such as cooking and homestay, similar to their cisgender counterparts. Unlike cisgender women, transgender women are more culturally sensitive, and try to blend in through the use of cultural artefacts such as clothing, and by attempting to learn and speak the language. However, limits to blending in exists based on the extent of \u2018passability\u2019 and success. The absence of attention in their home country means that transgender women seek more attention from countries that display tolerance. In terms of their perception of poverty, they, like many other individuals from wealthy nations, believe that poverty is associated with nobility and that poor people are actually happy. Overall, the research indicated that while transgender women travellers are similar to cisgender women in many ways, there are some differences.","tags":["Sociology","Social Science","Signifiers","Transgender","Passability","Transgender Woman","Transgender Travellers","Gender","Male-to-Female Transgender"],"date":"2023-02-17T15:21:49.693781","doi":null,"subjects":["Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","Arts and Humanities","Other Arts and Humanities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nvukj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/nvukj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/nvukj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nvukj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_305"}

The unobserved fact can be a quality of the sender the receiver would like to know and act upon. Signaling theory has been used to explain individuals\u2019 investments in higher education, advertisement, cultural consumption, aggressive behavior, and decision-making in social dilemmas. In this chapter, we give an overview of how signaling theory can be used to explain trust and trustworthiness in social exchange. After restating the core elements of the theory, we discuss conceptual extensions to the basic framework which have proved useful in explaining trust and trustworthiness in social exchange. In particular, we show how distinguishing between signaling costs and benefits, signals and signs, and the production and display of signals and signs can make signaling theory more broadly applicable in sociological scholarship. We illustrate these conceptual extensions with empirical evidence from laboratory experiments.

{"osf_id":"anfjw","title":"Self-coded occupation question with good measurement properties and numerical scores","description":"Occupation is the single best indicator of a person's place in the social hierarchy and is sometimes used as a measure of \"permanent income\". Occupations are critical elements in institutional structures of modern societies and in careers, so devising measurements to represent key features of occupations has elicited continuing research over many decades. \nWhy a new measure? (1) The field has several excellent detailed measures, based on verbatim self-reports in two questions on job title and duties\/ tasks on the job. Hence, they are costly in survey data collection time and also require hand coding by trained coders which is both expensive and slow.  Thus far, automated coding has not proven satisfactory. The measure we advocate, VOS, overcomes these difficulties. Moreover, unlike other short scales in current use, it predicts outcomes at least as well as the leading detailed measure.\nThe Vertical Occupational Status Method (VOS) methodology consists of \n\u2022\t[1] a concise self-coded survey question for measuring occupation that defines eleven logical and intuitively clear functional categories of occupation in a status hierarchy from low to high (VOSqnr);  This is what the respondent sees;\n\u2022\t[2] quantitative occupational status scores for these categories which are applicable worldwide (VOSstatus); \n\u2022\t[3] links between the VOS categories and the 4-digit International Standard Classification of Occupations (VOSISCO). \nIt has been used successfully in internet, paper-and-pencil, and show-card formats.

However, there has not been much change in environmental behavior, hence a different kind of curricular approach is required. Research has identified that effective environmental curricula are contextualized, situated and transdisciplinary, and co-owned by students. These engender radical shifts in cognition, affect and behavior and create an understanding of the cause and consequences of environmental issues and inspire environmental activism. The curricula enable student voice and choice.  However, for a curriculum to be transformative it must also explicitly integrate the cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions of learning.  PBL is a constructivist pedagogy which meets several criteria for transformative curricula.  PBL uses learner centric practices including inquiry, collaboration, scaffolding, reflection and technology, and opportunities for action to create transformative learning experiences. While PBL has not been widely used in India, the few implementations have shown positive results.  PBL should be widely adopted as an educational approach to address environmental issues in India.  However, there are several challenges which must be identified and addressed for effective PBL implementation.","tags":["Conceptual Paper","Environmental Education","project based learning","India"],"date":"2023-02-19T04:23:10.427709","doi":"","subjects":["Education","Curriculum and Instruction","Educational Methods"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/94vkq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/94vkq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/94vkq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/94vkq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_311"}
{"osf_id":"hmdz4","title":"Preregistration of research for theses \u2013 a  new standard?","description":"The reproducibility crisis is the ongoing methodological crisis, where it is difficult or impossible to reproduce the results of many scientific studies. Because the reproducibility of scientific results is an essential part of science, such failures undermine the credibility of the theories and potentially call into question a substantial part of scientific knowledge. There are several ways to strengthen the reproducibility of results, such as proper reporting and dissemination, e.g., pre-registration of research, registered reports, open data, open code, open research notes, or open access. In this paper, I propose incorporating preregistration into the theses writing process for undergraduate students, which should lead to enhanced reproducibility, transparency, and openness of research results in the context of final theses. Pre-registration is a data-marked, predetermined, read-only research roadmap that, in most cases, is created before the study and published in a public repository. Preregistration increases the credibility, transparency, openness, and robustness of students' results in writing their theses. It also serves as a tremendous educational and communicative element of the thesis writing process that raises the level of student theses and demonstrates a certain level of student knowledge and skills. In this paper, I propose a timeframe for incorporating pre-registration into theses writing processes and discuss the challenges surrounding this process from the perspective of key stakeholders - policymakers, universities, theses supervisors, and students. The article also presents practical advice on where to find support and further guidance on pre-registration aspects. This paper thus pioneers the idea of incorporating preregistration into the normal thesis writing process.","tags":["greyliterature","preregistration","undergraduate","DMP","datamanagementplan","thesis","openscience","reproducibility"],"date":"2023-02-19T13:15:15.417442","doi":null,"subjects":["Curriculum and Instruction","Educational Methods","Scholarly Publishing","Other Education","Information Literacy","Science and Technology Studies","Scholarly Communication","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Library and Information Science","Higher Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hmdz4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/hmdz4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/hmdz4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hmdz4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_312"}

Most of the poor households are also affected by frequent drought and change in monsoon pattern, and other natural disasters, leaving them with few mechanisms to cope with rising food prices. Nepal is characterized both by a highly variable climate regime and by fragile ecosystems. Its temperature is increasing at alarming rate 0.06\u00b0c per annum more than the global average. This phenomenon of climate change has directly affected the natural resources like land, water and forest resources. Those people who directly depend on these resources are becoming vulnerable day by day. To verify this, a case study entitled \u201cClimate Change, Forests, and Communities: Examining the Complex Interactions and Implications for Livelihoods\u201d was conducted in Jumdanda Jhapri Community Forest and Parche Community Forest of Bandipur Municipality, Tanahun district. The main objective of the study was to present the local level climate change impacts on forest and livelihood of the forest users\u2019 and to identify adaptation measures for improving livelihoods of the people while reducing their vulnerability to climate change. Also, the objective of the program is to assess the trend of change in temperature and rainfall in the study area.\n\nBoth primary and secondary information were collected from the field using participatory rural appraisal tools and techniques such as household survey, key informants interview, focus group discussion, and direct observation and transect walk of forest areas, and related reports and publications. Out of 106 households of Jumdanda Jhapri Community Forest, 32 households were selected, and out of 100 households of Parche Community Forest, 30 households of all caste and all categories of well-being of people were selected by simple random sampling method. Climatic data of the study area were collected form the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Kathmandu. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS, Ver.20 and MS-Excel 2010.\n\nMajority of the people in both community forests were found to be dependent on agriculture and it is found this sector has been adversely affected by the climatic variability. The invasive species is increasing rapidly in the forest, the water resources are depleting and soil productivity decreased in the community forests. This report assesses the nature and type of climate change impacts on forests and forest dependent people in Nepal, by reviewing available literature and compiling the observations and perceptions of local people. A key conclusion coming out of this review is that climate change is not only an issue of international concern but is now a local problem in Nepal.","tags":["forest","livelihood","Climate change","CC impact","CC adaptation"],"date":"2023-02-20T01:43:20.923537","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zag7x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/zag7x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/zag7x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zag7x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_314"}

The objective of this study is to highlight the fact that the WTO has vital efforts to strengthen the legitimacy of the global economic governance mechanism and liberalize economic activity in the world economic system. In a more liberalized transnational relations environment, the activities, operations, and efforts of nonstate actors provide a ground to stabilize economic cooperation and sustainable development. From a macro perspective, the study aims to monitor the first five-year period of the global financial crisis (2008-2013) and present the descriptive statistics and intercorrelations for 36 OECD countries.

The Linguistic Niche hypothesis claims that languages with numerous native speakers and substantial proportions of non-native speakers (societies of strangers) will tend to lose grammatical distinctions. In contrast, languages in small, isolated communities should maintain or expand their range of grammatical markers. Here, we test such claims using a new global dataset of grammatical structures - Grambank. We model the impact of the number of native speakers, the proportion of non-native speakers, the number of linguistic neighbors, and the status of a language on grammatical complexity while controlling for spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation. We deconstruct \"grammatical complexity\" into two separate dimensions: (i) how much morphology a language has (\"fusion\"), and (ii) the amount of information obligatorily encoded in the grammar (\"informativity\").  We find several instances of weak positive associations but no inverse correlations between grammatical complexity and sociodemographic factors.

A multilevel propensity score matching approach","description":"This paper examines the role of the community context in the estimation of the effect of fertility on households\u2019 economic wellbeing in rural Vietnam. Contextual characteristics can strongly influence both fertility and economic wellbeing and therefore it is crucially important to account for them in order to draw valid causal inference. The multilevel dimension introduces statistical complications and stimulates interesting research questions. We implement multilevel propensity score matching (PSM) techniques and propose a weaker version of the traditional SUTVA assumption. This assumption is usually overlooked in causal inference studies in demographic research, but it may be violated in the presence of spillover effects (interference). We propose a version of SUTVA that allows the effect of fertility on economic wellbeing to also depend on the overall fertility level in the community. We find a negative and substantively important effect of fertility on economic wellbeing and that the effect is stronger in high-level fertility communities, denoting the presence of spillover effects. On the contrary, fertility measured at the community level does not have a significant effect per se on households\u2019 economic wellbeing.","tags":["interference","sutva","Vietname","fertility","multilevel models","multilevel","causal inference","propensity score","poverty","propensity score matching","economic wellbeing"],"date":"2023-02-20T16:27:03.739642","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Statistics","Other Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wap63\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/wap63\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/wap63","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wap63","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_317"}
{"osf_id":"c3qm5","title":"Child Fostering in a Changing Climate: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa","description":"An extensive social science literature has examined the effects of climate change on human migration. Prior studies have focused largely on the out-migration of working-age adults or entire households, with less attention to migration among younger and older individuals. In this study, we focus on the implications of climate variability for the movement of children by examining the association between climate exposures and the in- and out-fostering of children in sub-Saharan Africa. We link high-resolution temperature and precipitation records to data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for 26 sub-Saharan African countries. We fit a series of regression models to measure the overall associations between climate exposures and each outcome, and then evaluate whether these associations are moderated by socioeconomic status, the number of children in the household, and the prevalence of fostering in each country. We find that precipitation is positively associated with in-fostering overall, and that effects are especially strong among households who already have at least one child and in countries where child fostering is common. We find no overall relationship between either temperature or precipitation exposures and out-fostering, but we do detect significant effects among households with many children and those with more-educated heads. Overall, this study demonstrates that new attention to the links between climate variability, child fostering, and other understudied forms of spatial mobility is needed to fully understand the effects of climate change on human populations.","tags":["climate change","child fostering","demography","migration","Africa"],"date":"2023-02-20T20:05:31.500577","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Environmental Sociology","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Population","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Policy","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c3qm5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/c3qm5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/c3qm5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c3qm5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_318"}
{"osf_id":"ecgzh","title":"Benefits of open access (OA) to researchers from lower-income countries: Tracing evidence through an analysis of reference patterns","description":"Making scientific literature freely available to everyone is a main objective of the open access (OA) movement. This may be of particular importance to researchers in lower-income countries, where access to literature is often hindered by high subscription costs. This study addresses this issue by analyzing reference lists of the world\u2019s output of scientific publications over time. The core issues addressed include whether researchers from lower-income countries refer to fewer previous publications when they publish and how this pattern develops over time. Moreover, whether researchers from lower-income countries rely more on literature that is openly available through different OA routes than other researchers is explored. The study shows that the proportion of OA references increases over time for all publications and country groups. However, the main finding is that publications from lower-income countries have a higher growth rate of OA references. This suggests that an increase in OA publishing has been particularly beneficial to researchers in lower-income countries.","tags":["Scientific publishing","Bibliometrics","Open Access","Knowledge organization"],"date":"2023-02-21T13:07:05.252996","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Scholarly Publishing","Library and Information Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ecgzh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/ecgzh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/ecgzh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ecgzh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_319"}
{"osf_id":"qr89d","title":"Universities as anarchic knowledge institutions","description":"Universities are knowledge institutions. Compared to several other knowledge institutions (e.g., schools, government research organisations, think tanks), research universities have unusual, anarchic organisational features. We argue that such anarchic features are not a weakness. Rather, they reflect the special standing of research universities among knowledge institutions. We contend that the distributed, self-organising mode of knowledge production maintains a diversity of approaches, topics and solutions needed in frontier research, which involves generating relevant knowledge under uncertainty. Organisational disunity and inconsistencies should sometimes be protected by institutional structures and procedures in order for research universities to best serve their purpose as knowledge institutions. The quality control for the knowledge produced stems from knowledge fields, clusters of knowledge and research that exist beyond the confines of individual organisations. The diversity of epistemic contributions is therefore kept in check by the order imposed by the internal logic of science as a social practice. Our argument provides a new defence for the autonomy of research conducted at universities.","tags":["knowledge production","knowledge field","higher education","frontier research","institutional epistemology"],"date":"2023-02-21T14:06:00.232382","doi":null,"subjects":["Arts and Humanities","Science and Technology Studies","Philosophy of Science","Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Philosophy","Higher Education"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qr89d\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/qr89d\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/qr89d","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qr89d","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_320"}

This paper uses PISA test score data for 2012, 2015, and 2018 to characterize the academic achievement of foreign-born children of 3,480 return migrants in 72 birth countries and 43 countries of residence. It compares them to non-immigrants in their parents\u2019 origin country as well as counterparts in children\u2019s birth countries. Using meta-analytic and fixed effects models, it also examines how policies and features of countries are associated with outcomes. Results show that, on average, these children obtain lower PISA scores than local children in their parents\u2019 countries of birth as well as children of similar migrants in their countries of birth. However, results vary greatly by country. Children of return migrant groups with greater resources appear better able to excel academically.","tags":["education","return migration"],"date":"2023-02-21T16:44:38.642503","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology of Education","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","International Migration"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hsp3u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/hsp3u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/hsp3u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hsp3u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_323"}
{"osf_id":"bgvqf","title":"Social Ties, Family Structure and Care, and the Well-Being of the Oldest Old in China","description":"The growing number of the elderly in China is bringing dramatic changes into family life, the nature and structure of the support system for the aging population. Especially with the growing decrepitude in physical health and experiences of the inevitable losses of the significant others among the oldest old, it is crucial to understand how different compositions of family members or other social ties provide support or care for the oldest old to sustain a certain quality of life. The goal of this study is to explore how family structure and care and other social ties affect the extent to which the oldest old assess the quality of life after controlling for their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, using data from the first wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Ordered logistic regressions are conducted and multiple imputation are applied to compute missing data. Findings in this study show that the demographic factors, including age, residential area, and physical health status, affect the life of the oldest old. Previous socioeconomic status of the oldest old have a cumulative effect on life quality over the life course. Most importantly, how family is structured impacts the well-being of the oldest old in China. Children play an important role in the life of the oldest old. They not only provide financial assistance and caregiving but also affection and love for the elderly, which greatly improves their subjective feeling about life. Extended family structures of multiple younger generations further have a positive effect on the well-being of the elderly. The reification of the traditional norm of enjoying the happiness of living together with multiple younger generations in their late life appears to be crucial to the emotional well-being of the elderly. Those who are living in nursing homes are more likely to feel better than those living with family members at home, indicating that nursing homes not only function in providing care for the daily routine of the elderly but also serve as a social setting for the elderly to socialize and make friends with their contemporaries. This reinforces their feelings of social attachment, hence, improves their subjective feeling of the life quality. Social services, provided by the government for the oldest old who do not have a family support, can facilitate financial support, formal caregiving, and the social life of the oldest old. They need to be taken into consideration to improve the life quality of the oldest old in China.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-21T23:14:52.090349","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Aging and the Life Course","Social Psychology and Interaction"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bgvqf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/bgvqf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/bgvqf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bgvqf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_324"}

We address this question using European Social Survey data, studying the association in occupational rank and social class between parents and children, and how it varies by region. Both ways of measuring occupational mobility produce similar results but there is a clear distinction between upward mobility, largely driven by structural change, and relative mobility which is thought to closer reflect (in)equality of opportunity. Capital regions are hubs of absolute upward, but not always relative, mobility. Absolute upward mobility is correlated with a range of human capital, labor market, demographic, and socio-spatial characteristics. By contrast, the only robust predictor of relative mobility is income differences between social classes. More inequality entails less mobility, and this relationship holds within countries.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-22T09:17:46.382783","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gzwha\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gzwha\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gzwha","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gzwha","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_325"}

Using a nationally representative survey (n=1100), we measured participant\u2019s intentions to take collective climate action (such as volunteering, sharing climate change information with friends, protesting), and actual behavioural engagement with Extinction Rebellion (XR), a large-scale environmental movement. We also measured psychological factors based on the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA) model, such as social identification, and socio-demographic characteristics. We found 50% of the participants were inclined abstainers, i.e., they expressed intentions to take collective climate action despite not having performed any actions with XR so far. Based on a moderated mediation model, we found that social identification predicted behavioural engagement with XR but did not moderate the collective climate action intention-behaviour gap. We discuss why this may be the case, including the role of public perceptions of how effective and disruptive XR's actions are.","tags":["SIMPEA","Extinction rebellion","Collective action","Intention-behaviour gap","Environmental psychology","Climate activism","Social identity"],"date":"2023-02-22T10:44:53.187126","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4ksgw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/4ksgw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/4ksgw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4ksgw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_326"}
{"osf_id":"bmupw","title":"Perceived Racial Threats Increase Demand for Conservative Media: Evidence from Black Lives Matter Protests and Fox News Ratings","description":"With the growing evidence that the content on Fox News Channel (FNC) influences its viewers' attitudes and behaviors, it is important that we better understand the real-world factors driving demand for FNC, especially among those who are not already frequent viewers. Yet, our ability to identify these factors is plagued by difficult methodological issues, most notably, the selection problem of inferring the determinants of demand from content. This study overcomes these challenges by exploiting the substantial spatial and temporal variation in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests during 2020, the year of George Floyd's murder and other prominent police killings of Black Americans, to examine whether perceived racial threats increased FNC viewership. We construct a census block group-week panel of BLM protests and FNC ratings during 2020. With this spatial panel, we test whether the local occurrence of a BLM protest increased the portion of the local population watching FNC in the subsequent period. We find that the number of FNC viewers rose by approximately 2% following a BLM protest. At the same time, we find evidence that viewership of CNN, a moderate news channel, was unaffected and possibly declined. Our results, which survive robustness checks, tests of the modeling assumptions, and replication at the census tract level, can be interpreted as causal under reasonable assumptions. The findings provide real-world evidence that perceived racial threats increase demand for conservative media.","tags":["Fox News","Racial threat","Protest","Status threat","Black Lives Matter","Conservative media"],"date":"2023-02-22T14:50:54.814383","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology","Collective Behavior and Social Movements","Political Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","American Politics","Political Science","Race, Gender, and Class"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bmupw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/bmupw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/bmupw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bmupw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_327"}

While this encounter is all-important, Scitovsky\u2019s ideas need at the same time to be read in the context of the evolution of his critique of 20th century mass society. The present paper presents that critique and demonstrates its fundamental importance for Scitovsky\u2019s diagnosis of an economy he termed joyless. Drawing upon his Memoirs, we show how Scitovsky\u2019s ideas were initially shaped by the culture\/aesthetics of his early years in Budapest, followed by his experiences of rising totalitarianism in inter-war Europe, and further affected by his move to the consumption society of post-war America. Important the way he engaged with the writings of influential contemporary cultural commentators, including Andr\u00e9 Gide, Erich Fromm, Bertrand de Jouvenel, Lewis Mumford and Bernard Rudofsky.

Furthermore, a uni-dimensional approach may not suffice to describe ideology coherently. We thus develop a novel way to measure voter ideology: Combining expert and voter survey data, we use classification models to infer how experts would place voters based on their policy stances on three axes: general left-right, economic left-right and libertarian-authoritarian. We validate our approach by finding i) a strong connection between policies and ideology using data-driven approaches, ii) a strong predictive power of our models in cross-validation exercises, and iii) that \u201cobjective\u201d ideology as predicted by our models significantly explains the vote choice in simple spatial voting models even after accounting for the subjective ideological distance between voters and parties as perceived by the voters.

We hypothesized that there would be a strong association between social satisfaction and self-perceived mental health improvement, and that living alone would be a risk factor to self-perceived improvement. Study Design: Our strengths-based quantitative study aims to identify the most important factors to psychosis survivors for their mental health recovery. Survey responses from wave 5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study were used, specifically from those who self-identified as psychosis survivors (n = 710), analyzing the association between self-reported mental health symptoms, social satisfaction changes in the last year, living alone, and demographic variables, with self-reported mental health recovery in the last year. Study Results: Ordinary least squares regression analysis revealed three predictors of self-reported mental health improvement for psychosis survivors: social satisfaction, living alone, and lower anxiety. As hypothesized, social satisfaction was the largest determinant in self-perceived mental health improvement, but contrary to our hypothesis, living alone was a protective factor. Conclusion: Prioritizing social satisfaction over group living environments for people recovering after psychosis.","tags":["schizophrenia","personal recovery","social isolation","relationship satisfaction"],"date":"2023-02-22T23:18:15.940752","doi":"10.1093\/schizbullopen\/sgac052","subjects":["Social Work","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r3jze\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/r3jze\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/r3jze","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r3jze","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/schizbullopen\/sgac052","dataset_id":"socarxiv_344"}

While most scientists were affected by the pandemic to some extent, evidence shows that women with caregiving responsibilities were disproportionately impacted, with long-term effects on their careers. However, despite calls for change by scientists globally, whose careers depend largely on funding success, decision-makers have made little to no effort to reform a funding system that marginalises a large proportion of researchers, including women, and especially mothers.

{"osf_id":"q2s7c","title":"The Dissimilarity Index Was Never Compositionally Invariant","description":"The prevailing view is that White\/Black segregation has experienced modest declines in recent decades, while White\/Hispanic and White\/Asian segregation have remained stable. This consensus is based on the assumption that segregation measures, such as the ubiquitous dissimilarity index, are free of systematic bias on city compositions, a property known as compositional invariance. This property is necessary because, while the Black population has remained stable in the U.S., the Hispanic and Asian populations have experienced significant growth. In this paper, we demonstrate that the assumption of compositional invariance for the dissimilarity index is fundamentally flawed and propose an easily-implementable adjustment factor to facilitate meaningful segregation comparisons of cities over space and time. The implications of this adjustment are stark: we find that White\/Hispanic and White\/Asian segregation have substantially decreased, with Hispanic segregation declining more rapidly than Black segregation.  Our findings also highlight the exceptional nature of Black segregation, with the gap in their measured dissimilarity - after adjusting for compositional changes - persisting when compared to White segregation with other racial\/ethnic groups.","tags":["Compositional Invariance","Dissimilarity Index","Residential Segregation","Historical Segregation Trends"],"date":"2023-02-23T19:39:42.998670","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Statistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Sociology","Methodology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q2s7c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/q2s7c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/q2s7c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q2s7c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_347"}

Citation-based data usually need too long to accrue. In this study, we propose a method based on bibliometric data for the identification of potential young talented individuals. Since potential talent is defined in this study in terms of early publication performance, three different indicators and their combinations were used: We not only used (1) the number of papers in high-impact journals, but also (2) the total number of papers, and (3) the number of papers as a corresponding author. An older cohort with their first publication between 1999 and 2003 was used to find the most suitable indicator combination. Two additional indicators were used for the validation step: (1) the citation impact on the level of individual papers and (2) the number of papers that are linked to grants were used. The best performing indicator combination was applied to the time period 2007-2011 for identifying young potential talented individuals who published their first paper within this time period.

{"osf_id":"b75fr","title":"Manual versus Machine: How Accurately Does the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) Classify Different Document Types into Disease Areas?","description":"The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) for classifying journal articles. It is increasingly used by researchers studying medical innovation to classify text into disease areas and other categories. Although this process was once manual, human indexers are now assisted by algorithms that automate some of the indexing process. NLM has made one of their algorithms, the Medical Text Indexer (MTI), available to researchers. MTI can be used to easily assign MeSH descriptors to arbitrary text, including from document types other than publications. However, the reliability of extending MTI to other document types has not been studied directly. To assess this, we collected text from grants, patents, and drug indications, and compared MTI\u2019s classification to expert manual classification of the same documents. We examined MTI\u2019s recall (how often correct terms were identified) and found that MTI identified 78% of expert-classified MeSH descriptors for grants, 78% for patents, and 86% for drug indications. This high recall could be driven merely by excess suggestions (at an extreme, all diseases being assigned to a piece of text); therefore, we also examined precision (how often identified terms were correct) and found that most MTI outputs were also identified by expert manual classification: precision was 53% for grant text, 73% for patent text, and 64% for drug indications. Additionally, we found that recall and precision could be improved by (i) utilizing ranking scores provided by MTI, (ii) excluding long documents, and (iii) aggregating to higher MeSH categories. For simply detecting the presence of any disease, MTI showed &gt; 94% recall and &gt; 87% precision. Our overall assessment is that MTI is a potentially useful tool for researchers wishing to classify texts from a variety of sources into disease areas.","tags":["research policy","innovation studies","science policy","categorization","classification"],"date":"2023-02-24T13:29:44.570959","doi":null,"subjects":["Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Science and Technology Studies","Science and Technology Policy"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/b75fr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/b75fr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/b75fr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/b75fr","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_349"}
{"osf_id":"wv7xt","title":"Perceptions Matter: Quasi-Experimental Evidence on the Effects of Spain's New Minimum Income on Households' Financial Wellbeing","description":"This paper examines how minimum income schemes (MISs) affect households\u2019 financial wellbeing and whether this effect differs across objective material conditions and households\u2019 perceptions. Two reasons motivate this study. First, while the Covid-19 pandemic, the ecological transition and the cost-of-living crisis have all prompted a renewed interest in MISs, no consensus exists on how effective these schemes are in improving households\u2019 financial wellbeing. Second, when evaluating MISs, the literature focuses on objective measures of financial wellbeing, namely monetary poverty. Yet, peoples\u2019 perceptions of their own situation can be instrumental in affecting their health, productivity and decision-making and can reveal important information about adaptation mechanisms or spillovers to non-recipients. This paper examines the case study of Spain, a country that introduced a new MIS in 2020. The study uses Eurostat survey data for the 2010-2022 period in a Synthetic Control Method analysis. The results show that, while the policy had no significant effect on objective financial wellbeing measures (i.e. the poverty rate, the poverty gap and mean income) for its first year and a half of existence, it did considerably improve subjective financial wellbeing after two years and a half, as it helped households feel less pessimistic about the evolution of their finances during the Covid-19 and cost-of-living crises. The paper discusses several mechanisms explaining this differentiated impact of the policy, such as its lagged rollout, the improvements made to the benefit from 2022 as well as anticipation, placebo and positive spillover effects of the MIS. The findings highlight the importance for practitioners to consider subjective measures when assessing income support schemes.","tags":["subjective wellbeing","financial wellbeing","quasi-experiment","minimum income","poverty","social assistance","Synthetic Control Method"],"date":"2023-02-24T14:35:24.748364","doi":null,"subjects":["Income Distribution","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social Statistics","Social Policy","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation","Economics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wv7xt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/wv7xt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/wv7xt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wv7xt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_350"}

We theorize the introduction of and successive changes in platform-based experimentation as constitutive of the experimental hand. Our model of the experimental hand captures how successive changes in platform-based experimentation regimes reconfigure workers\u2019 degree of autonomy: workers first experienced increased autonomy, followed by diminished autonomy, and finally workers normalized their diminished autonomy as a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d aspect of work life on the platform.

{"osf_id":"bp79r","title":"The Religious Right and Russia: Christian Nationalism and Americans' Views on Russia and Vladimir Putin Before and After the Ukranian Invasion","description":"Since 2016, Americans\u2019 attitudes toward Russia and Vladimir Putin have shifted, with Republicans becoming far more supportive of both. And though condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 remains bipartisan, many Christian-right leaders still support Putin and Russia. What undergirds this support? Drawing on three national data sets, we theorize Americans\u2019 warmth toward Putin and Russia is reinforced by an ideology that seeks to institutionalize America\u2019s mythical Anglo Protestant ethno-culture\u2014Christian nationalism. Though we propose Christian nationalism\u2019s relationship with Russia is more contingent on Russia\u2019s geopolitical activity vis-\u00e0-vis the US, we theorize Christian nationalism consistently predicts Putin support due to his authoritarian ethno-nationalism. April 2018 data show those who affirm America\u2019s Christian heritage in the past and\/or present are more likely to view Putin and Russia favorably and Russia as our ally. March 2021 data also reveal a linear positive association between Christian nationalism and favorability toward Putin. And March 2022 data reveal a linear positive association between Christian nationalism and admiring Putin\u2019s leadership. They also show a U-shaped curvilinear relationship with viewing Russia as a threat. Paradoxically, Christian nationalism may warm Americans toward foreign authoritarians like Putin even when it compels Americans to perceive their nations as threats.","tags":["Christian nationalism","Russia","sociology of religion","religious right","evangelicals","Republicans","sociology","Christian right","fascism","Donald Trump","Ukraine","authoritarianism","Russian Orthodox","Putin","religion"],"date":"2023-02-25T20:06:06.851391","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Sociology of Religion","Political Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","American Politics","Political Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bp79r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/bp79r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/bp79r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bp79r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_352"}
{"osf_id":"8ybqw","title":"Efficient scale and scope of business models used in municipal solid waste management","description":"The paper compares the efficiency of alternative municipal solid waste management business models: a single provider against multiple providers. The drivers of municipal solid waste management costs are analysed to test the impact of the scale and scope of municipal solid waste management services on the average cost. While the business-as-usual scenario foresees a single provider, the alternative scenario foresees multiple providers. Based on the empirical data on municipal waste management costs, on average, the size and the average cost of the service are inversely related. This trend is supported using subsets defined by the quantity of waste managed. Multiple factors aid in explaining this result, and among others, due to scale and scope, factors such as transition costs increase with the number of players running different services. The provision of public services of economic interest should favour the participation of more companies wherever possible to the extent that social surplus is produced. However, pursuing this principle to the detriment of efficient service delivery is not ideal. This paper demonstrated that a single-provider waste management business model is efficient under specific conditions, as in this article. This paper presents an original research methodology for comparatively analysing waste management service efficiency in urban areas and provides adequate evidence using alternative measures of costs according to the phase of the waste management chain, the scale, and ultimately the scope of municipal solid waste management services.","tags":["economies of scope","Waste management","economies of scale","circular economy","business model","public service"],"date":"2023-02-26T11:29:16.419366","doi":"10.1108\/EJMBE-09-2022-0271","subjects":["Urban Studies and Planning","Environmental Studies","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Political Science","Economics","Industrial Organization"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8ybqw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/8ybqw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/8ybqw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8ybqw","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1108\/EJMBE-09-2022-0271","dataset_id":"socarxiv_353"}

Further analyses indicate Christian nationalism is the strongest predictor that Americans view voting as a privilege, not a right.

The evolution of investment strategies for transitions to zero carbon over the last two decades provides insights that will assist in shaping strategies for biodiversity-positive investments. Many emerging approaches to capture company impact and dependence on biodiversity focus on nature-related threats to an organisation by looking at the composition of local ecosystems and sustaining ecosystem services. Other approaches have a different objective function, focusing on minimizing an organisation\u2019s contribution to risks of species extinction by using data sets such as the IUCN\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. However, in both cases, many of the threat assessments that could link corporate activities to impacts are incomplete and omit critical information, and the models that use these links are largely untested for use in portfolio construction. If the investment community focuses on biodiversity without sufficient forethought, there is a risk of entrenching metrics with significant flaws. In this paper we suggest that until such time as species threat assessments are complete and the metrics to which they contribute are fully developed and tested for use, interim approaches to guide investments can leverage off disclosure-based or taxonomy-based approaches developed for climate investing. We present and discuss two potential such metrics, a Biodiversity Management Quality metric and a Biodiversity Revenues metric.","tags":["disclosure","biodiversity finance","ESG","sustainable investment"],"date":"2023-02-27T15:01:27.119618","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Studies"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gxwst\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gxwst\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gxwst","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gxwst","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_356"}

The National Identity Threat Trust model (NITT) is theorized and tested. Empirically, structural equation modelling was performed on survey data from the last wave of EVS Italy (2017). The analysis showed that the ethnic majoritarian conception has a positive impact on perceived collective threats (realistic and symbolic) and trust\u2010related emotions, which in turn influence support for discriminatory migrant employment policy. The civil conception contributes indirectly to increasing support for native employment priority via positive association with the perception of economic and symbolic threats. Citizens close to right-wing nativist parties exhibit a similar relationship structure to the rest of population. However, the \u201cnativist\u201d politicization of attitudes towards immigrants makes the symbolic threat a particularly salient factor.","tags":["attitudes towards migrants","european values study","nationalism","national identity","nativism","perceived ethnic threats","Italy"],"date":"2023-02-27T15:33:22.133024","doi":"10.4000\/qds.4754","subjects":["Sociology","Collective Behavior and Social Movements","Social Psychology and Interaction","Political Sociology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Political Science","International Migration"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yrf4j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/yrf4j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/yrf4j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yrf4j","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4000\/qds.4754","dataset_id":"socarxiv_357"}
{"osf_id":"gqh5b","title":"Occupational licensure, unionization, and workplace variation  in pay inequality between immigrants and natives","description":"Organizational research has revealed considerable variation in immigrant\u2013native pay inequalities across workplace contexts, but less is known about how broader labor market institutions intersect in local dynamics of wage setting between employees of immigrant and native backgrounds. We argue that increased workplace concentrations of union members and employees in licensed occupations constrain organizational opportunity structures for discrimination and reduce immigrant\u2013native wage gaps. We analyze longitudinal linked employer\u2013employee administrative data for the Norwegian labor market and find that immigrants and their descendants experience smaller wage gaps relative to native Norwegian coworkers in highly unionized and, to a lesser extent, licensed workplaces. The advantages of high workplace unionization and occupational licensure are larger for immigrant-origin employees who are union members or working in licensed occupations. Our findings support the claim that institutional regulation in the workplace reduces the organizational scope for unequal pay based on immigrant status.","tags":["wages","labor unions","relational inequality theory","immigration","occupational licensure"],"date":"2023-02-27T18:30:34.417364","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","International Migration","Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility","Organizations, Occupations, and Work","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Economic Sociology","Racial and Ethnic Minorities"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gqh5b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gqh5b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gqh5b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gqh5b","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_358"}
{"osf_id":"gu7yh","title":"Translating Intersectionality to Fair Machine Learning in Health Sciences","description":"Machine learning (ML)-derived tools are rapidly being deployed as an additional input in the clinical decision-making process to optimize health interventions. However, ML models also risk propagating societal discrimination and exacerbating existing health inequities. The field of ML fairness has focused on developing approaches to mitigate bias in ML models. To date, the focus has been on the model fitting process, simplifying the processes of structural discrimination to definitions of model bias based on performance metrics. Here, we reframe the ML task through the lens of intersectionality, a Black feminist theoretical framework that contextualizes individuals in interacting systems of power and oppression, linking inquiry into measuring fairness to the pursuit of health justice. In doing so, we present intersectional ML fairness as a paradigm shift that moves from an emphasis on model metrics to an approach for ML that is centered around achieving more equitable health outcomes.","tags":["prediction models","intersectionality","machine learning","algorithmic justice","algorithmic fairness"],"date":"2023-02-27T21:08:37.932360","doi":null,"subjects":["Sociology","Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration","Social Statistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Race, Gender, and Class"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gu7yh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/gu7yh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/gu7yh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gu7yh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_359"}

How Voters Perceive Rule-Based Direct Transfers in India","description":"Developing democracies increasingly have welfare programs that use objective rules to identify beneficiaries, and directly transfer benefits to intended recipients, cutting out party intermediaries. This policy shift has potential to attract new voters, but runs the risk of alienating core supporters. To understand these electoral trade-offs, I leverage a natural experiment involving a large rule-based direct transfer program in India (a $2000 house), as well as survey experiments. Contrary to expectation, I find that core supporters do not punish their party for substantially benefiting out-groups. Among out-groups, receipt of benefits does not durably increase support for the ruling party. These findings shed new light on the impediments to distributive reform: it is ambivalent policy winners (out-groups), not angry losers (core supporters), that disincentivize politicians from reducing discretion and favoritism.","tags":["reform","corruption","welfare state","clientelism","CCT","political economy","ethnic politics","welfarism","developing countries","direct transfers","distributive politics","india"],"date":"2023-02-27T22:49:27.175027","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Comparative Politics","Political Science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nwpqh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/socarxiv\/nwpqh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/nwpqh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nwpqh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"socarxiv_360"}
