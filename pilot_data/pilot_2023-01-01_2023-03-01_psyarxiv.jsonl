{"osf_id":"qh4n7","title":"Cognitive biases and speech connectedness in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders","description":"Cognitive biases are systematic tendencies in the processing, selection and remembering of information. They are prevalent in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and are particularly associated with positive symptoms. The bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE) refers to a reluctance to integrate information that contradicts one\u2019s beliefs and is associated with delusions. There is also some evidence of a link between BADE and formal thought disorder (FTD), though this relationship remains to be fully explored. FTD can be objectively quantified through speech via computerized processing of speech transcripts in both clinical and non-clinical samples. We sought to examine the relationship between BADE and speech connectedness in SSD patients (n = 30) and non-clinical controls (n = 15). We hypothesized that lower speech connectedness would be associated with greater severity of BADE. Speech graphs assessing language connectedness were generated from manually transcribed speech samples acquired during semi-structured interviews. The results supported previous findings of a greater BADE in patients relative to controls. While speech connectedness did not differ between patient and control groups, it was associated with positive symptoms (delusions, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinations) in patients. The link between BADE and FTD differed depending on whether patients had a non-affective or an affective SSD. In non-affective patients, higher BADE was associated with higher conceptual disorganization, measured via symptoms interviews, whereas higher BADE was associated with lower speech connectedness in affective patients. These findings support the notion that cognitive biases are linked to FTD, but suggest that non-affective versus affective diagnosis may affect the way in which this link is manifested.","tags":["psychosis","natural language processing","speech structure","delusions","bias against disconfirmatory evidence","speech graphs","conceptual disorganization","formal thought disorder"],"date":"2023-01-01T02:24:17.018605","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Psychotic Disorders","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qh4n7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qh4n7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qh4n7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qh4n7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_0"}

While these kinds of systems are great at creating short pieces of information based on a prompt, they have severe limitations, and come nowhere close to general intelligence or digital sentience. Still, OpenAI's system allows for the integration of robust prompt completion in third party applications. Using their API, it may be possible to add layers of functionality that create a system that can keep track of information from multiple contexts and continuously process it in a way which at least mirrors consciousness. To determine how successful this system is, existing tests from psychology, such as the NEO PI-R and the MMPI-2 can be utilized.

{"osf_id":"vaegk","title":"The effect of ostensive communication on immediate and delayed memory of novel and familiar action patterns","description":"Actions are often learnt incidentally by observing other individuals. How aspects inherent to the social context in which an action is seen affect action learning remains poorly understood. Here we study the effect of a special social signal, the eye gaze of the demonstrator, on the immediate and delayed memory and execution of observed actions. In Experiment 1, healthy young adult volunteers watched short videos of a demonstrator performing novel actions with novel objects only once, and were tested for immediate and delayed recall of those actions through action execution. Overall, novel actions on novel objects were recalled more accurately if, during demonstration, the demonstrator had repeatedly gazed towards the participant (direct gaze) vs. towards an object (control condition). Experiment 2 investigated the immediate and delayed recall of novel and familiar object-use actions performed on familiar objects. In this condition, which involved familiar information, direct gaze had no effect or was even detrimental for recall. These findings show that direct gaze benefits incidental learning and retention of novel information only (novel actions paired with novel objects in Experiment 1), and interferes with the retention of familiar information (familiar objects paired with familiar actions in Experiment 2). This study suggests a role of ostensive eye contact in incidentally learning new actions. At the same time, it limits its beneficial role to a specific type of learning scenario, one involving only novel (as opposed to familiar) information, unveiling the selective function of ostensive eye contact in the transmission of novel cultural behaviors.","tags":["Novel Action","Action Learning","Action Imitation","Ostension","Memory for Actions","Eye Contact","Functional Action"],"date":"2023-01-01T13:46:02.592200","doi":null,"subjects":["Learning","Cognitive Psychology","Psychology, other","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vaegk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vaegk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vaegk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vaegk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_4"}

We discussed educational implications of the findings in terms of how relatability may be the first point of emphasis for moral educators to focus on and attainability can then bolster the effectiveness.

The ability to formulate presenting problems in psychotherapy is widely acknowledged, but little is known about the skills involved. Treatment manuals are necessarily directed to the general form of a problem and need to be invidualised to the specific needs and circumstance of someone seeking treatment through formulation.

Formulations are depicted in diagrams constructed according to a set of basic conventions. Aims. Following on previous preparatory studies, the present paper reports on a test of whether this method of analysis and representation could be taught and if the quality of the resulting diagrams could be reliably rated.

Symptom scores of the PASC group and the ME\/CFS group correlated .902 (p &lt;.0001). The hypothesis is presented that ME\/CFS and PASC are caused by a chronic state of multisystemic disequilibrium including endocrinological, immunological and\/or metabolic changes. The hypothesis holds that a changed set-point persistently pushes the organism towards a pathological dysfunctional state which fails to reset. To use an analogy of a thermostat, if the \u201coff switch\u201d of a thermostat intermittently stops working, for periods the house would become warmer and warmer without limit. The hypothesis draws on recent investigations of the Central Homeostasis Network showing multiple interconnections between the autonomic system, central nervous system and brain stem. The hypothesis helps to explain the shared symptomatology of ME\/CFS and PASC and the unpredictable, intermittent and fluctuating pattern of symptoms in ME\/CFS and PASC.

I will be exploring Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018identity metaphysics\u2019, his monism, his determinism, his dismissal of traditional cause-effect dichotomies, his anti-Aristotelian rejection of a fundamental distinction between objects and processes. It may appear peculiar to try and draw principled connections between Nietzsche\u2019s hatred of socialism and his view that tables and chairs are fundamentally indistinguishable from their qualities. However, many such relations can be drawn, largely by understanding Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy of language, potentially opening new avenues for understanding the origin of Nietzsche\u2019s seemingly variable, and often contradictory, positions about social relations and political hierarchies. For example, the more politically inflected readings of the will to power can be grounded in Nietzsche\u2019s assumptions about how objects intrinsically relate to their dispositions and qualities (their \u2018powers\u2019). I begin with a brief survey of Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018system\u2019, his philosophy of mind and language, before progressing to forms of ideological terrain that appear to be inter-related with his fundamental beliefs about the structure of reality.

These include neural responses and arousal responses for example. These types of measures can be expensive and technically challenging to collect as well as hard to interpret. Food advertisement offers the possibility to measure a unique physiological response that directly reflects the subjective value of a food to an individual: if something looks mouth-wateringly good, there will be an increase in spontaneous swallowing frequency.  In this proof-of-concept study we measured the frequency of swallowing of 16 participants (9 women) as they watched different types of advertisements. In the  product-centered condition  the product is visually in the foreground and presented in an appetitizing manner, while in the brand-centered condition the food itself is not shown. Swallowing was measured with electrodes placed on the skin below the jaw, where activity of the submental muscles can be measured. We observed that product-centric advertisements caused more swallowing than brand-centric advertisements, and the average purchase intention is higher. In conclusion, measuring swallowing-related muscle activity is an easy and relatively inexpensive neuromarketing technique that can be used to evaluate effectiveness of food advertisements.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-02T08:38:57.196114","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Consumer Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rxwc3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rxwc3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rxwc3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rxwc3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_14"}
{"osf_id":"pdhkf","title":"Explaining the curvature effect","description":"Preference for curvature, the\u00a0curvature effect, seems to transcend cultures, species and stimulus kinds. However, its nature and psychological mechanisms remain obscure because studies often overlook the complexity of contour characterisation and disregard personal and contextual factors. To investigate the curvature effect, we propose a continuous and multidimensional manipulation and contrasting experimental conditions examined at the group and individual levels that unveil a complex picture, not reducible to monotonous relationships:\u00a0Perceptual and hedonic evaluations relied on multiple geometric features defining contour and shape. These features were specifically weighted to characterise each construct, depending on the individual and contingent on whether evaluating perceptually or hedonically. Crucially, the curvature effect was not robust to preference with respect to the median and continuous manipulations of contour for varying shapes. As curved contours are more easily perceived and processed than polygons, we hypothesised that perceived contour might explain liking for a figure beyond the effect of geometric features, finding that this association was subordinated to shape categorisations. Finally, domain-specific, personality and cognitive-preference traits moderated how people used each geometric feature in their perceptual and hedonic evaluations. We conclude that research on perception and appreciation of contour and shape should factor in their complexity and defining features. Additionally, embracing individual sensitivities opens potential avenues to advance the understanding of psychological phenomena. In summary, our approach unpacks a complex picture of contour preference that prompts critical reflections on past research and advice for future research, and it is applicable to other psychological constructs.","tags":["perception","preference","contour","sensitivity","curvature effect"],"date":"2023-01-02T09:44:10.279967","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Vision","Psychology, other","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pdhkf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pdhkf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pdhkf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pdhkf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_15"}
{"osf_id":"wemkx","title":"Bisexual Stereotypes in Clinical Evaluation","description":"Psychologists nowadays tend to view same-sex attraction as a normal part of human sexuality, but it is less clear whether they still hold prejudicial views regarding bisexuality. Previous studies have demonstrated that psychotherapists\u2019 clinical evaluation is affected by whether their client is bisexual. One plausible interpretation is that such differences stem from an uncritical adoption of bisexual stereotypes, namely, that bisexual people are confused, immature, and unable to maintain romantic relationships. However, an alternative hypothesis suggests that differences in evaluation may be based on the psychotherapists\u2019 experience with bisexual clients. To adjudicate between these possibilities, psychotherapists and clinical psychology interns (N=229) were presented with a description of a hypothetical client\u2014a bisexual man, a gay man, or a heterosexual man\u2014seeking counseling for academic issues. Compared to non-bisexual clients, bisexual clients were evaluated as more likely to suffer from identity and relationship issues. These clinical evaluations were observed regardless of whether the therapist was personally acquainted with bisexual people or had any experience with bisexual clients. Instead, stereotypical clinical issues were perceived as particularly salient among psychotherapists who viewed the hypothetical bisexual clients as immature and confused.

{"osf_id":"zsd9r","title":"Disfluencies reflect a...hm... competition between response options: evidence from a drift diffusion analysis","description":"Disfluency can occur when a speaker faces difficulty in language production, but also as a strategy to stall for time and create an illusion of continuity in speech. To better understand the origin of disfluency, the current study used a drift diffusion model (DDM) in a context of semantic competition. We developed a speeded version of the picture\u2013word interference paradigm, in which participants name pictures while ignoring distractor words. We applied the DDM approach to data from related vs. unrelated distractors but also from fluent vs. disfluent answers (e.g. \u201capple\u201d vs. \u201chm...a-apple\u201d). All results were mapped onto the drift rate parameter. Unrelated distractor words resulted in a higher drift rate compared to semantic distractors, and fluent answers resulted in a higher drift rate compared to disfluent answers. Results suggest that picture-word interference taps into the process of spreading activation through the lexical-semantic system. Similarly, disfluency reflects competition between response options, and is not a strategy from the speaker to stall for time to accurately name the picture.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-02T12:17:36.315178","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zsd9r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zsd9r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zsd9r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zsd9r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_17"}

The first study was conducted online and used a large sample (n=902) of respondents. The second study was conducted in a laboratory setting and involved a stress induction procedure. For both, the task was to categorize whether the human vocalization was rated positive, neutral or negative. Stimuli were audio records extracted from freely downloadable online videos and can be considered semi-naturalistic. Each rating participant (rater) was presented with five audio records (stimuli) of five females and of five males. All raters were presented with the stimuli twice (so as to statistically estimate the consistency of the ratings). Using a Bayesian statistical approach, we could test for consistencies and due-to-chance probabilities. The outcomes support the prediction that the results (ratings) are repeatable (not due to chance) but incorrectly attributed, decreasing the communication value of the expressions of fear, pain, and pleasure.

In the lab, the specific target is typically known in advance, and remains the same across trials, resulting in a fixed memory representation. Here we studied a situation in which the target is not known a priori, and memory needs to be dynamically updated during the actual search. Observers compared two simultaneously presented arrays of objects for any matching pair of items. As any item in the display is a potential candidate, this task requires frequent memory updating in combination with sensory-memory comparisons. We ran two versions of the task, one in which scanning was easy (involving just eye movements), and one in which scanning was impeded (also involving mouse movements). In both versions, the response times, the number of transitions between displays, and the dwell time before each transition increased linearly with set sizes, consistent with regular updating of memory content. Importantly, there was a trade-off between memorizing and transitioning: When scanning was impeded, more items were memorized and observers switched less often between displays. When scanning was relatively easy, observers memorized less, but switched back and forth between displays more often. Thus, observers can adaptively shift between external sampling and internal memorizing during the search, revealing a dynamic interplay between memory and visual selection.","tags":["pair search","short-term memory","long-term memory","trade-off"],"date":"2023-01-03T02:05:21.370018","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/568q9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/568q9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/568q9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/568q9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_23"}

We exposed participants to 30 real-life social media posts, 15 of which were misinformation. While previous misinformation experiments have predominantly used perception- or intention-based outcome measures, our social media platform simulation measured engagement with misinformation, a more ecologically valid approach. Specifically, the \u2018reactions\u2019 of participants to each post were recorded. \n\nUsing pre-registered mixed-effects logistic regression models, we found that inoculation conferred the most protection against misinformation, significantly reducing \u2018likes\u2019\/\u2018loves\u2019 and \u2018reactions\u2019 compared to the control.

{"osf_id":"d8t3q","title":"The structure of psychiatric comorbidity without selection and assortative mating","description":"The widespread comorbidity observed across psychiatric disorders may be the result of processes such as assortative mating, gene-environment correlation, or selection into population studies. Between-family analyses of comorbidity are subject to these sources of bias, whereas within-family analyses are not. Because of Mendelian inheritance, alleles are randomly assigned within families, conditional on parental alleles. We exploit this variation to compare the structure of comorbidity across broad psychiatric polygenic scores when calculated either between-family (child polygenic scores) or within-family (child polygenic scores regressed on parental polygenic scores) in over 25,000 genotyped parent-offspring trios from the Norwegian Mother Father and Child Cohort study (MoBa). We fitted a series of factor models to the between- and within-family data, which consisted of a single genetic p-factor and a varying number of uncorrelated subfactors. The best-fitting model was identical for between- and within- family analyses and included three subfactors capturing variants associated with neurodevelopment, psychosis, and constraint, in addition to the genetic p-factor. Partner genetic correlations, indicating assortative mating, were not present for the genetic p-factor, but were substantial for the psychosis (b= 0.081;95% CI [0.038,0.124]) and constraint (b= 0.257;95% CI [0.075,0.439]) subfactors. When average factor levels for MoBa mothers and fathers were compared to a population mean of zero we found evidence of sex-specific participation bias, which has implications for the generalisability of findings from cohort studies. Our results demonstrate the power of the within-family design for better understanding the mechanisms driving psychiatric comorbidity and their consequences on population health.","tags":["polygenic scores","assortative mating","p factor","MoBa"],"date":"2023-01-03T07:47:33.650790","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Mental Disorders","Psychotic Disorders","Depressive Disorders","Bipolar and Related Disorders","Anxiety Disorders","Personality Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Feeding and Eating Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/d8t3q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/d8t3q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/d8t3q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/d8t3q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_25"}
{"osf_id":"yzxw9","title":"Prevalence, inequalities, and sequelae of bullying in adolescence: insights from the #BeeWell study","description":"Measurement is fundamental to understanding and prevention of bullying, but strategies in the field are inconsistent, producing much conflicting evidence. We illustrate this by demonstrating the sensitivity of findings to researcher-led analytical decisions (exposure threshold and type(s) of bullying considered), with a particular focus on prevalence, inequalities, and sequalae. N=35,825 adolescents aged 12-15 attending 147 secondary schools in the #BeeWell study completed measures of bullying and internalising mental health difficulties. These data were linked to information on their socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., socio-economic disadvantage).  Pre-registered analyses revealed the prevalence of bullying victimisation to range between 5% and 16%.  Inequalities in exposure to bullying were consistently found among gender and sexual minorities, those with special educational needs, younger students, and those from more disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  However, inequalities among females and ethnic minority groups varied by exposure threshold and type of bullying.  The population attributable fraction for the association between bullying exposure and internalising symptoms was found to range between 6% and 19%, with the odds-ratio ranging between 3.55 and 4.20. There was limited evidence that the impact of bullying varied across socio-demographic subgroups, except that bullying exposure was more strongly associated with internalising symptoms among LGBTQ+ young people and cisgender heterosexual females (than cisgender heterosexual males), and less strongly associated with internalising symptoms among Black students (than White students). Our findings speak to the importance of developing more consistent measurement practices in bullying research, with consequent implications for prevention and intervention. These implications are contextualised by consideration of study strengths and limitations.","tags":["mental health","measurement","bullying","prevalence","adolescence","inequalities"],"date":"2023-01-03T09:30:19.012874","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yzxw9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yzxw9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yzxw9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yzxw9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_26"}
{"osf_id":"agfc8","title":"Estimating the prognostic value of cross-sectional network connectivity for treatment response in depression","description":"Tightly connected symptom networks have previously been linked to treatment resistance, but most findings come from small sample studies comparing single responder vs. non-responder cross-sectional networks. We aimed to estimate the association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response in a large sample and benchmark its prognostic value against baseline symptom severity and variance. N=40,518 patients receiving treatment for depression in routine care in England from 2015-2020 were analysed. Cross-sectional networks were constructed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for responders and non-responders (N=20,259 each). To conduct parametric tests investigating the contribution of mean and variance to connectivity differences, networks were constructed for 160 independent subsamples of responders and non-responders (80 each, n=250 per sample). The baseline network of non-responders was more connected than responders (3.15 vs 2.70, S=0.44, P&lt;.001), but effects were small, requiring n=750 per group to have 85% power. Parametric analyses of the 160 independent networks revealed baseline network connectivity, mean, and variance were correlated (r=0.20-0.58, all P&lt;.001). Both mean (\u03b2=-1.79, SE=0.07, P&lt;.001), and variance (\u03b2=-1.67, SE=0.09, P&lt;.001) had larger effect sizes for predicting response than connectivity (\u03b2=-1.35, SE=0.12, P&lt;.001). The association between connectivity and response disappeared when variance was accounted for (\u03b2=-0.28, SE=0.19, P=.14). We replicated these results in patients completing a longer duration of treatment (8-12 weeks, N=22,952) and using anxiety symptom networks (N=70,620). The association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response may be largely due to differences in baseline symptom variance.

During complex problem solving (CPS), problem solvers have to interact with the task in a way in which learning ability might be beneficial for successful task completion. By investigating the relationship between learning ability and CPS, while accounting for interactions between complex system characteristics and person characteristics, this paper aims to understand the role of learning processes in CPS more closely. In a sample of N = 241 participants, we performed a preregistered analysis to investigate the relationship between knowledge acquisition performance in a CPS test (MicroDYN) and learning test performance (ADAFI) with a multilevel modelling approach across 10 CPS systems with various characteristics. In line with our expectations, we replicated previous findings on a relationship between learning test and MicroDYN performance and found this relationship to be more pronounced in systems with (vs. without) autonomous changes. Further system and person characteristics also showed effects as expected, with better performance in systems with lower complexity, with more experience with the task, and with more strategic exploration behaviour. Our results provide further evidence for the notion that learning is an important component for the successful completion of CPS tasks.","tags":["multilevel","MicroDYN","learning ability","ADAFI","system characteristics"],"date":"2023-01-03T11:44:14.596899","doi":"10.1016\/j.intell.2023.101773","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Learning","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Individual Differences","Testing and Assessment","Psychometrics","Reasoning","Problem Solving","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fw7vm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/fw7vm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/fw7vm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fw7vm","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.intell.2023.101773","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_28"}

{"osf_id":"wx9ve","title":"Influences of familiarity and recollection on value-based decision-making","description":"We regularly retrieve information from memory to inform decisions we make in daily life. For example, when choosing a place to eat, we may be enticed by a brand name because of its familiarity or drawn to an independent restaurant because of recollections of a delicious lunch we had there once before. Despite the centrality of memory in such everyday choices, it remains unclear how these different memory processes (i.e., familiarity versus recollection) influence decision-making. Here we describe a novel experimental paradigm that tests the independent contributions of these processes to value judgement during risk-based decision-making. In this task, participants had to retrieve the source of an image from an earlier encoding task to infer the probability of a bet being rewarded. We examined behavior in this task across two experiments, one conducted fully online and the second both online and in-laboratory. We found that familiarity, manipulated by the number of presentations during encoding, increased subjective value during memory-based decision-making. False familiarity even increased betting on lure items with which participants had no prior exposure. Further, we observed evidence that familiarity and source value information interacted, such the effect of both familiarity and source value information on betting were enhanced when both were high. Our results highlight the importance of subjective familiarity in both directly increasing perceived value, and indirectly influencing the use of value information retrieved from source memory.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-03T15:33:19.569125","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wx9ve\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wx9ve\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wx9ve","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wx9ve","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_32"}

The aim of this thesis is to achieve a deeper understanding and improve terminological clarity of SED in a psychedelic context, here defined as research settings in which moderate to high doses of psilocybin are administered. SED is investigated from two different psychological perspectives to demonstrate how different understandings of the self and ego can contribute differently to the understanding of SED. Firstly, Freud\u2019s theory of the subject constitutes a psychoanalytical perspective, which focuses on intra- and intersubjective processes in the constitution of the subject. Secondly, Rose\u2019s theory of the subject constitutes a postmodern perspective, which focuses on contextual processes in the constitution of the subject. A qualitative systematic review (SR) is conducted to apply these theories analytically to empirical data on SED. The SR consists of 10 studies containing qualitative descriptions of subjects\u2019 experiences with SED in a psilocybin-assisted psychotherapeutic (PAP) context. A thematic analysis of the subjects\u2019 experiences is presented, and synthesized into four meta-themes that describe recurring characteristics of SED. These are 1) a stronger feeling of essence, 2) a greater feeling of connection, 3) a different bodily experience, and 4) a challenging but eventually blissful or meaningful experience. On the basis of the psychoanalytic analysis, it is suggested that SED can be understood as related to changes in the boundaries of the meta-psychological I and regression to primary processes including the fantasy and the skin ego. Additionally, based on the postmodern analysis it is suggested that SED can be understood as influenced by an unusual psy-context. Critical reflections on how the thesis contributes to the understanding of SED are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen theories and empirical data are discussed, specifically regarding interpretation bias, generalizability, data extraction, validity, causality, and eclecticism. It is concluded that the thesis provides insights important to psychological understandings of SED, insights that have potential clinical relevance. However, it is also argued that the investigation highlights that SED is a phenomenon that is difficult to capture and therefore should be investigated further from alternative psychological perspectives.","tags":["postmodern theory","psilocybin","psychedelics","ego dissolution","psychoanalytic theory"],"date":"2023-01-03T16:31:03.781533","doi":null,"subjects":["Self and Social Identity","Social and Personality Psychology","Clinical Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Therapy","Psychotherapy","Psychopharmacology","Substance Abuse and Addiction","Clinical Neuropsychology","Depressive Disorders","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f26ce\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/f26ce\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/f26ce","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f26ce","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_33"}

The fascination about what may be out there is only matched by asking who might be out there. Exopsychology is concerned about how humans think about extraterrestrials but also how extraterrestrials may think, feel, and behave. It strives to find generalizable psychological theories to enrich and extend the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Producing technosignatures requires that a species skillfully realizes the relevant possibilities for action, which the environment offers in all its socio-material richness. These possibilities are called affordances. They are not fixed but relational to individual and collective available abilities and customs. We apply an affordance perspective to specify the relation between information processing, body, environment, and material engagement in the context of space exploration and SETI. In this way, we can uncover aspects of the psychological configurations that SETI requires from its extraterrestrial targets, but which are also critical to the human practice of space exploration. Moreover, we elaborate on arguments against employing the concept of \u201cintelligence\u201d in SETI. A successful first contact requires a mutual attunement to species-typical diachronic backdrops, which constitute meaning. One possibility for a meaningful message form and content is the reference to the material environment and its respective engagement. Meaningfulness of affordances is conserved in a form of life and transmitted via social interaction. Considering affordances within SETI fosters an understanding of how the thinking, feeling, and behavior of life forms in the Universe emerge in relation to their socio-material environment.","tags":["Material Engagement","Affordances","Psychology","Extraterrestrial Intelligence","METI","Exopsychology","Communication","SETI","Philosophy","Aliens"],"date":"2023-01-03T17:09:46.648186","doi":"10.1016\/j.actaastro.2023.05.034","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9frzj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9frzj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9frzj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9frzj","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.actaastro.2023.05.034","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_35"}
{"osf_id":"phztn","title":"Mimicry in misophonia: A large-scale survey of prevalence and relationship with trigger sounds","description":"Background\nMisophonia is often referred to as a disorder that is characterized by excessive negative emotional responses, including anger and anxiety, to \u201ctrigger sounds\u201d which are typically day-to-day sounds, such as those generated from people eating, chewing, and breathing. Misophonia (literally \u2018hatred of sounds\u2019) has commonly been understood within an auditory processing framework where sounds cause distress due to aberrant processing in the auditory and emotional systems of the brain. However, recent evidence from brain imaging showing involvement of the motor system while listening to trigger sounds suggests that it is the perception of action (e.g., mouth movement) of the trigger person, and not the sounds per se, that drives the distress in misophonia. Since observation or listening to sounds of actions of others are known to prompt automatic mimicry\/imitations in perceivers, we hypothesized that mimicking the action of the trigger person may be prevalent in misophonia. Apart from a few case studies and anecdotal information, a relation between mimicking and misophonia has not been systematically evaluated. \n\nMethod\nIn this work, we addressed this limitation by collecting data on misophonia symptoms and mimicry behaviour using online questionnaires from 676 participants. \n\nResults\nAnalysis of these data shows that (i) the tendency to mimic varies in direct proportion to misophonia severity assessed using a self-reported questionnaire, (ii) compared to other human and environmental sounds, trigger sounds of eating and chewing are more likely to trigger mimicking, and (iii) the act of mimicking provides relief from distress to most people with misophonia. \n\nLimitations\nThe format of the study as an online survey used questionnaires to assess misophonia status. The questionnaire has been used extensively in misophonia research, however it is not fully validated for use in clinical populations, therefore we cannot be certain on the degree of severity of symptoms reported in this study population.\n\nConclusion\nThis study shows that mimicry is widely prevalent in misophonia and is elicited by the most common trigger sounds of eating and chewing. These data reinforce the idea of hyper-mirroring in misophonia proposed in our earlier work (Kumar et al., 2021). Thus, providing crucial implications for how we treat and interpret misophonia moving forward.","tags":["Mimicry","Misophonia","Social cognition"],"date":"2023-01-03T17:54:25.910259","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/phztn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/phztn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/phztn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/phztn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_36"}

This pilot examines the acceptability and utility of an SSI designed to help adolescents improve functionality appreciation (a component of body neutrality) by focusing on valuing one\u2019s body based on the functions it performs, regardless of appearance satisfaction. \nMethod: Pre- to post-intervention data were collected, and within-group effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were computed, to evaluate the immediate effects of the SSI on hopelessness, functionality appreciation, and body dissatisfaction. Patterns of use, demographics, program feedback, and responses from within the SSI were collected.\nResults: The SSI and all questionnaires were completed by 75 adolescents (ages 13-17, 74.70% White\/Caucasian, 48.00% woman\/girl) who reported elevated body image and mood problems. Analyses detected significant pre-post improvements in hopelessness (dav = 0.60, 95% CI 0.35, 0.84; dz = 0.77, 95% CI 0.51, 1.02), functionality appreciation (dav = 0.72, 95% CI 0.46, 0.97; dz = 0.94, 95% CI 0.67, 1.21), and body dissatisfaction (dav = 0.61, 95% CI 0.36, 0.86; dz = 0.76, 95% CI 0.50, 1.02). The SSI was rated as highly acceptable, with a mean overall score of 4.34\/5 (SD = 0.54).

To increase access to mental health services, we must have a clear understanding of the barriers adolescents face from their own perspectives. This online mixed methods study aimed to enhance understanding of access barriers by centering the perspectives of diverse adolescents who had recently tried and failed to access mental health support.\nMethods: In this convergent parallel mixed methods study, adolescents responded to a pre-intervention, open-ended question about barriers they have faced to accessing mental health services when they needed them, and shared information about their background and depressive symptoms. Barriers were assessed using inductive, conventional content analysis. Quantitative analyses examined barrier differences across sociodemographic groups.\nResults: All adolescents (ages 11-17, 50% racially minoritized youth, 15% gender diverse youth, 64% LGBTQ+ youth; 78% with clinically-elevated depressive symptoms) reported at least one barrier to accessing mental health support, and 20% reported multiple barriers. Content analysis revealed 13 barrier categories, with parent-related barriers (3 different categories) accounting for 32% of all barriers. The most common barrier categories related to personal and financial constraints. Asian adolescents, adolescents who were 17 or older, and adolescents who reported uncertainty of their gender identity endorsed the numerically highest mean number of barriers to accessing mental health support.\nConclusions: High-symptom adolescents reported myriad barriers to accessing mental health support, with 32% of all barriers related to parents.\nImplications and Contribution: Findings from this study point to a need to increase parent mental health literacy, strengthen family communication about adolescent mental health needs, and to empower adolescents to independently access safe, effective mental health supports, sometimes regardless of parental support.","tags":["mental health","barriers to care","service access","adolescents","health disparities","clinical psychology"],"date":"2023-01-03T21:12:35.382049","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/a9mcr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/a9mcr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/a9mcr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/a9mcr","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_39"}

Irrelevant neuroscience information in the form of text or imagery has been found to improve ratings of quality of, and agreement with, scientific explanations, and to possibly affect jury decisions in court. On the other hand, several studies have yielded little to no effect. To establish the magnitude of this effect, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis on all studies that compared neuroscience to non-neuroscience information for impact on ratings or judgment, including mock juror decisions. This analysis used 60 experiments from 28 publications comprising 13,088 participants, and yielded a mild but highly significant effect of neuroscience information (Hedges\u2019 g = .25, CI = [0.18, 0.31]). There was evidence of publication bias and heterogeneity (PI = [-0.22, 0.72], I2 = 87.2%). After removing outliers, we conducted planned subgroup analyses, which revealed that within-subjects studies, in which participants compare neuroscience to non-neuroscience, have significantly stronger effects than between-subjects designs, and studies using text yield a stronger average effect than those using brain images. We also serendipitously found that effect sizes were stronger in studies where participants evaluate satisfaction or metacomprehension, compared with jury verdicts or assessments of convincingness. Overall, the heterogeneity indicates there is more than one type of SANE effect, having more to do with stimuli used and outcomes assessed, than with participant characteristics, such as dualistic beliefs. Irrelevant neuroscience does appear to have a seductive allure, especially on self-appraised satisfaction and understanding, and when presented as text.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-04T03:33:28.775395","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Influence"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bcgdz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bcgdz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bcgdz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bcgdz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_40"}

Yet, systematic reviews of reporting practices in the field have shown that journal articles do not meet this goal and that guidelines for writing them better have not resulted in a sufficient improvement to reporting transparency.\nARTEM-IS aims to address this issue by building dynamic, interactive web applications that support documenting information required by existing publication guidelines in the form of a standardised metadata template. Completing an ARTEM-IS form results in a human-reader-friendly PDF and a machine-readable JSON summary of methodological information, which allows for a level of reporting precision higher than what is typically found in journal articles. These can be used as supplements to a publication, as a memory aid when writing a paper, or as records that allow easier metadata extraction in comparison to verbal descriptions in papers.\nHere, we present the ARTEM-IS for ERP, which supports describing a typical ERP study, including most of its core methodological aspects (study description, experimental design, hardware, data acquisition, pre-processing, measurement, visualisation, additional comments). We discuss the current contents of the form, web application functionalities, current limitations, and potential directions for future developments. In addition, the process of building the form contents and the web application through a collaborative grassroots initiative is described. Finally, we argue that a wider adoption of ARTEM-IS can bring benefits to different stakeholders: researchers themselves or their collaborators, especially on large-scale projects, reviewers, readers of a paper, and the scientific community at large.","tags":["ARTEM-IS","event-related potentials","standardisation","transparency","open science"],"date":"2023-01-04T04:10:04.525510","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Clinical Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mq5sy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mq5sy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mq5sy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mq5sy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_41"}

The preferred design for learning about causal effects are randomized experiments (i.e., studies in which the researchers randomly assign units to treatment and control conditions). However, randomized experiments are often unethical or unfeasible. On the other hand, observational studies are usually feasible but lack the random assignment that renders randomized experiments causally informative. Natural experiments can sometimes offer unique opportunities for dealing with this dilemma, allowing causal inference on the basis of events that are not controlled by the researcher but that nevertheless establish random or as-if random assignment to treatment and control conditions. Yet, psychological researchers have rarely exploited natural experiments so far. To remedy this shortage, we describe three main types of studies exploiting natural experiments (standard natural experiments, instrumental variable designs, and regression discontinuity designs) and provide examples from psychology and economics to illustrate how natural experiments can be harnessed. Natural experiments are challenging to find, provide information about only specific causal effects, and involve assumptions that are difficult to validate empirically. Nevertheless, we argue that natural experiments provide valuable causal inference opportunities that have not yet been sufficiently exploited by psychologists.","tags":["observational studies","natural experiments","quasi-experiments","causal inference","randomized experiments","regression discontinuity design","instrumental variable estimation"],"date":"2023-01-04T10:24:06.560508","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dah3q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/dah3q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/dah3q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dah3q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_43"}

In particular, our theories should account for (a) how children learn to coordinate across multiple levels (e.g., managing turn-taking, negotiating shared understanding, and engaging in coherent exchange with the interlocutor), (b) how they learn to use multimodal signaling in face-to-face interactions, and (c) how they adapt to the communicative conventions of their linguistic community while using their skills flexibly across various conversational contexts. \nI outline one promising research approach that has the potential to better handle this elusive phenomenon; an approach that capitalizes on new technological opportunities in remote data collection methods and high-scalability Machine Learning tools to help provide a quantitative understanding of how children grow to become competent communicators.","tags":["Computational modeling","Conversation","Child Development","Multimodal"],"date":"2023-01-04T13:53:44.907337","doi":null,"subjects":["Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Language Aquisition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4f3ny\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4f3ny\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4f3ny","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4f3ny","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_46"}

For instance, retrospective emotion evaluations are often biased by discrete salient timepoints, such as the peak and end moments, at the expense of objective event duration (i.e., peak-end effects and duration neglect). However, how these retrospective emotion biases originate, as well as their significance for emotional functioning, remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that retrospective emotion biases are related to fundamental limits of temporal processing and memory capacity. Further, we examine whether these limits have implications for emotional functioning. Participants (n = 60) underwent a novel paradigm comprising affectively-rich movie sequences while providing emotion ratings continuously (moment-by-moment) and retrospectively. Temporal memory for previously-watched emotional-movie sequences and dispositional negativity were measured. Our findings revealed a greater \u2018end\u2019 bias as emotional-movie sequence duration increased, suggesting that limitations in temporal processing capacity may contribute to retrospective emotion biases. Critically, temporal-memory errors were associated with larger retrospective emotion biases and with individual differences in dispositional negativity.

Artificial intelligence has been undergoing a purported \u201cparadigm shift\u201d initiated by new machine learning models, large language models (e.g., BERT, LAMMA, and that behind ChatGPT). These models have led to unprecedented accuracy over most computerized language processing tasks, from web searches to automatic machine translation and question answering, while their dialogue-based forms, like ChatGPT have captured the interest of over a million users. The success of the large language model is mostly attributed to its capability to numerically represent words in their context, long a weakness of previous attempts to automate psychological assessment from language. While potential applications for automated therapy are beginning to be studied on the heels of chatGPT\u2019s success, here we present evidence that suggests, with thorough validation of targeted deployment scenarios, that AI\u2019s newest technology can move mental health assessment away from rating scales and to instead use how people naturally communicate, in language.","tags":["Psychology","Assessment","Large Language Models","Artificial Intelligence","Transformers"],"date":"2023-01-04T17:21:27.314135","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Statistical Methods","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yfd8g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yfd8g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yfd8g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yfd8g","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_48"}

Although researchers have started examining the desistance process, all studies have been looking from a deficiency perspective, thus, ignoring the strengths that may help them leave the gang. This phenomenological study aimed to study the importance of strengths played in gang desistance among Latino men former gang members from Southern California. Seven men were recruited to participate in this study. All had considered themselves affiliated and desisted from gangs at the time of participation. Participants were, on average, 33 years old and all were Latino. The mean years of gang participation were 13.3 (SD = 5.4) and desisted 8.2 years (SD = 10.5). Educational levels varied, and all participants were employed. Our findings suggest that former gang members do not always endorse negative or vicarious experiences in their gang desistance as suggested by previous studies. For the participants in our study, the interrelationship between different psychological processes (e.g., agency, empathy), values (e.g., education, family) and environmental resources (e.g., peers, mentors) facilitated the process of becoming inactive or former gang members.","tags":["street gangs","Strength-based","positive psychology","Gang desistance","gangs","prison gangs"],"date":"2023-01-04T17:28:11.688443","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Multi-cultural Psychology","Cultural Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/psd9k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/psd9k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/psd9k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/psd9k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_49"}

{"osf_id":"6y5nw","title":"Neural processing the global properties of natural auditory scenes","description":"Conscious perception of an auditory scene is often assumed to rely on the identification and segregation of multiple objects making sounds around the same time. However, it is possible that a more global process may also occur when we evaluate auditory scenes. Studies in the visual domain have identified global properties that aid in our rapid recognition of visual scenes \u2013 even without identifying each individual object within it. Recent behavioral work from our lab has provided preliminary evidence for the use of global properties in natural auditory scene perception. The present study aims to expand these preliminary findings and investigate neural processing of natural auditory scenes. During EEG recording, participants will listen to 200 scenes and will be asked to complete a \u201csetting\u201d task and an object identification task, separately. Scenes will then be categorized into a \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d group based on their scores on factors 1 and 2 from the exploratory factor analysis conducted in McMullin et al. (in prep). A cluster-based analysis on temporal response functions will be used to identify distinct spatio-temporal response patterns associated with scene- and object-related processing. Additional cluster-based analyses on time-frequency data will assess distinct changes in power and periods of inter-trial phase coherence associated with scene and object processing. The results of this study will better inform us of the neural activity related to natural auditory scenes composed of real, recognizable objects.","tags":["auditory scene perception","auditory object perception","brain source analysis","event-related potentials","time-frequency analysis"],"date":"2023-01-04T19:28:23.420820","doi":null,"subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Audition","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6y5nw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6y5nw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6y5nw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6y5nw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_53"}

Facial mimicry is not a mere motor copy but reflects social context in service of social goals like facilitating affiliation. The study of social context has focused on face-external settings like interpersonal relations. The impact of face-internal social context on facial mimicry has, surprisingly, not been investigated yet. Here, we test if social information carried by facial shape, specifically trustworthiness and dominance, influences facial mimicry. We used virtual avatar faces from an established database known to be perceived as strongly (non-)dominant or (non-)trustworthy and added smiling, frowning, and neutral expressions. We video-recorded facial reactions and asked participants to self-report on arousal, valence, and dominance they experienced. In a second task, the same participants were asked to deliberately imitate facial expressions. We show that self-reported feelings differ in arousal, valence, and dominance by expression, and that valence is affected by dominance and trustworthiness traits. Both social traits also affect the deliberate imitation of the expression, in particular movements around the eyes. However, we did not find any significant impact of any facial social trait on spontaneous facial expressions. Thus, our results show that, despite the spatial overlap of facial social traits and expression signals, facial mimicry circuits may be immune to the face-internal social context in the absence of an external social context.","tags":["social perception","social trait","social communication","facial expression","emotion","facial mimicry"],"date":"2023-01-04T19:45:29.090780","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ay9rt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ay9rt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ay9rt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ay9rt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_54"}

Computerized cognitive trainings, which originated in the experimental psychopathology literature, have gained considerable attention as a possible approach for addressing this need-to-access gap. In this Perspective, we describe the current state of the literature on computerized cognitive training interventions for psychopathology. Drawing on longstanding principles from learning theory and cognitive psychology, we discuss several reasons why many of these interventions (e.g., cognitive bias modification) have not yet achieved their considerable potential as cost-effective, scalable, and effective digital therapeutics. We also consider distinguishing features that may help to explain why some computerized cognitive training programs (e.g., cognitive remediation) tend to show more robust effects than others. Finally, we leverage insights across basic and applied branches of psychology to offer concrete recommendations for building more robustly effective digital interventions moving forward.","tags":["cognitive training","digital mental health interventions","cognitive control training","cognitive bias modification","meta-science"],"date":"2023-01-04T22:14:13.817241","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/w2dpk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/w2dpk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/w2dpk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/w2dpk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_55"}

For each frequency band, a piecewise growth curve model was fit, resulting in an estimated intercept and two slope parameters from 2\u20139 months and 9\u201324 months of age. Across 6\/7 frequency bands, absolute power significantly increased over age, with steeper slopes in the 2\u2013\u00ac9 month period compared to 9\u201324 months. Increased family income, but not maternal education, was associated with higher intercept (2\u20133 month power) across delta\u2013gamma bands (p range = 0.002 to 0.04), and reduced change in power between 2\u20139 months of age in lower frequency bands (delta-alpha, p range = 0.01-0.02).

We comprehensively examine the psychometric properties of the machine-inferred personality scores, including reliability (internal consistency, split-half, and test-retest), factorial validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. Participants were undergraduate students (n = 1,444) enrolled in a large southeastern public university in the U.S. who completed a self-report Big-Five personality measure (IPIP-300) and engaged with an AI chatbot for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. In a subsample (n = 407), we obtained participants\u2019 cumulative grade point averages (GPAs) from the University Registrar and had their peers rate their college adjustment. In an additional sample (n = 61), we obtained test-retest data. Results indicated that machine-inferred personality scores (a) had overall acceptable reliability at both the domain and facet levels, (b) yielded a comparable factor structure to self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores, (c) displayed good convergent validity but relatively poor discriminant validity (averaged convergent correlations = .48 vs. averaged machine-score correlations = .35 in the test sample), (d) showed low criterion-related validity, and (e) exhibited incremental validity over self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores in some analyses. In addition, there was strong evidence for cross-sample generalizability of psychometric properties of machine scores.

{"osf_id":"vyz9p","title":"A Comparison of HIPAA-Compliant Transcription Services for Virtual Psychiatric Interviews","description":"Background: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology is increasingly being used for transcription in clinical contexts. Although there are numerous transcription services using ASR, few studies have compared the word error rate (WER) between different transcription services among different diagnostic groups in a mental health setting. There has also been little research into the types of words ASR transcriptions mistakenly generate or omit. \nObjective: This study compared the WER of three ASR transcription services (Amazon Transcribe, Zoom\/Otter AI, and Whisper\/Open AI) in interviews across two different clinical categories (controls, and participants experiencing a variety of mental health conditions). These ASR transcription services were also compared to a commercial human transcription service, REV. Words that were either included or excluded by the error in the transcripts were systematically analyzed by their Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) categories. \nMethods: Participants completed a one-time research psychiatric interview, which was recorded on a secure server. Transcriptions created by the research team were used as the gold standard from which WER was calculated. The interviewees were categorized into either the control group (N = 18), or the mental health condition group (N = 47) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The total sample included 65 participants. Brunner-Munzel tests were used for comparing independent sets such as the diagnostic groupings, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for correlated samples when comparing the total sample between different transcriptions services.\nResults:  There were significant differences between each ASR transcription service WER (P &lt; .001). Amazon Transcribe\u2019s output exhibited significantly lower WERs compared to the Zoom\/Otter AI and Whisper\/Open AI ASR.  ASR performances did not significantly differ across the two different clinical categories within each service (P &gt; 0.05). A comparison between the human transcription service output from REV and the best-performing ASR (Amazon Transcribe) demonstrated a significant difference, with REV having a slightly lower median WER (7.6% versus 8.9%). Heatmaps and spider plots were used to visualize the most common errors in LIWC categories, which were found to be within three overarching categories: Conversation, Cognition, and Function.\nConclusions: Overall, our results suggest that the WER between manual and automated transcription services may be narrowing as ASR services advance. This is consistent with the trend in the literature where, depending on the context, WER has dropped from around 30% in the early 2000\u2019s [1] to 10-15% in the 2010\u2019s [2] to under 10% in recent years [3]. These advances, coupled with decreased cost and time in receiving transcriptions, may make ASR transcriptions a more viable option within healthcare settings. However, more research is required to determine if errors in specific types of words impact the analysis and utility of these transcriptions, particularly for specific applications and in a variety of populations in terms of clinical diagnosis, literacy level, accent, and cultural origin.","tags":["Word Error Rate","Transcription","Mental Health","HIPAA","Speech To Text","ASR","Interview","WER","Automatic Speech Recognition"],"date":"2023-01-05T02:00:16.105306","doi":null,"subjects":["Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vyz9p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vyz9p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vyz9p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vyz9p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_58"}

The heart of the problem is inadvertently laid bare in a brief passage in Noel and Angelaki (2022), in which they express, clearly and seemingly unaware of its implications, the prevailing homuncular view of brain function. This view is a necessary companion to the idea of neural activity as constituting a \u201ccode,\u201d since the decoding of this code is, in practice, left to the investigator, and in theory to an implicit, free-floating and unexamined homunculus. The failures of reproducibility and replication are due to the blind adoption of the ad hoc coding concept (and, indeed, a very specific ad hoc version of it) which stands in for tested theory and licenses post hoc data analysis. The post hoc approach is known to be fragile with respect to replicability, as the failures of AI (also said to be in crisis) illustrate.","tags":["crisis","replicability","correlation","spike-rate","code","post hoc","homuncular","reproducibility","coding","neuroscience","brain"],"date":"2023-01-05T08:23:59.745127","doi":null,"subjects":["Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tk2vc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tk2vc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tk2vc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tk2vc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_60"}

To explain partisan differences in attitudes to vaccines, researchers have tended to focus on a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach combining partisan cues and motivated reasoning. In this paper, we study the evolution of intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19 over time by drawing on 34 cross-sectional surveys covering a period of approximately a year and a half (March 2020-June 2021, n=38 416). Across the whole period, people who felt closest to parties on the Far Right, the Far Left and those who felt closest to no party at all were more likely to not intend to vaccinate than people who felt closest to parties on the Left, the Right and at the Center. To explain partisan differences in attitudes to vaccines, researchers have focused on a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach combining partisan cues and motivated reasoning. We show that this approach can explain only very partly these results and that it does not pay sufficient attention to disengagement with politics.

It remains an open question what the neuronal correlates of these experiences are and where they emerge within the visual pathway. To allow future testing of suggested underlying mechanisms (e.g., changes in functional connectivity, neural entrainment), we sought to systematically characterise the effects of frequency (3 Hz, 8 Hz, 10 Hz and 18 Hz) and rhythmicity (rhythmic and arrhythmic conditions) on flicker-induced subjective experiences. Using a novel questionnaire, we found that flicker frequency and rhythmicity significantly influenced the degree to which participants experienced simple visual hallucinations, particularly the perception of Kl\u00fcver forms and dynamics (e.g., motion). Participants reported their experience of geometric patterns and dynamics was at highest intensity during 10 Hz rhythmic stimulation. Further, we found that frequency-matched arrhythmic FLS strongly reduced these subjective effects compared to equivalent rhythmic stimulation. Together, these results provide evidence that flicker rhythmicity critically contributes to the effects of FLS beyond the effects of frequency alone, indicating that neural entrainment may drive the induced phenomenal experience.","tags":["visual hallucinations","stroboscopic light","flicker light stimulatio","altered states of consciousness","Kl\u00fcver forms"],"date":"2023-01-05T10:00:53.016844","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zbqc2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zbqc2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zbqc2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zbqc2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_62"}

Acceptability of POIs is seen as an important factor contributing to the effectiveness of the implementation online help in healthcare. This article aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Attitudes towards Psychological Online Interventions (APOI-PL) with a sample of volunteers from the community. In Study 1 (N = 304), a confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the original four factors (Anonymity benefits, ABE; Technologization threat, TET; Confidence in effectiveness, CON; Scepticism and perception of risks, SCE) and adequate internal consistency. The APOI-PL demonstrated partial invariance over gender. In Study 2 (N = 162), criterion validity with the use of a personality measure (IPIP NEO-Five Factor Inventory-50) and virtual social integration were shown. The Openness was negatively related to the SCE and ABE, and positively with CON. Agreeableness is related to higher positive attitudes but lower SCE and TET; however, the correlations are low.

However, since memory retrieval consists of different stages, divided attention can impair each stage uniquely, leading to retrieval failures. It is important to acknowledge the multistage characteristics of episodic memory retrieval to understand the cognitive mechanisms that mediate the relationship between memory retrieval and divided attention. Here we attempt to unravel the role of divided attention in gating the access to long-term memories through its unique impact on a non-exhaustive list of six stages of a memory retrieval task: processing of retrieval cue, initiating a retrieval mode, searching for the target memory, retrieving, and reactivating the target memory, decision-making, and motor preparation to produce a response. We describe how each stage might be affected by divided attention. To do so, we review not only studies on memory retrieval but also areas that constitute different stages described above given the lack of extensive research that explores the role of attention for each stage. We hope this work will contribute to carefully controlling and manipulating how different stages are affected by attention, which in turn will improve our understanding of the relationship between attention and memory retrieval.","tags":["divided attention","selective attention","working memory","episodic memory retrieval","retrieval mode"],"date":"2023-01-05T15:01:44.968474","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/839by\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/839by\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/839by","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/839by","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_64"}

Early investigations suggested that this difficulty was due to the representational challenge of adding an additional logical element to a proposition. In more recent work, however, supportive contexts mitigate the processing costs of negation, suggesting that pragmatics can modulate this difficulty. We test the pragmatic hypothesis that listeners\u2019 processing of negation is influenced by expectations about speakers\u2019 production of negation by directly comparing speakers and listeners in two pairs of experiments. In both experiments, speakers produce negative sentences more often when they are both relevant and informative. And in both experiments, listeners in turn are fastest to respond to sentences that they expect speakers to produce. We argue that general pragmatic principles that apply to all sentences can help explain the challenges of processing negation.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-05T15:11:51.537030","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5b2xr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5b2xr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5b2xr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5b2xr","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_65"}

However, despite decades of research, limited progress has been made on clarifying the mechanisms that account for their beneficial effects. We know that many treatments work, but we know relatively little about why they work. Mechanisms of change may be obscured due to prior research collapsing across heterogeneous subgroups of patients with differing underlying mechanisms of response. Studies identifying baseline individual characteristics that predict differential response (i.e., moderation) may inform research on why (i.e., mediation) a particular subgroup has better outcomes to an intervention via tests of moderated mediation. \nMethod: In a recent randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week meditation app with a control condition in school system employees (N=662), we previously developed a \u201cPersonalized Advantage Index\u201d (PAI) using baseline characteristics, which identified a subgroup of individuals who derived relatively greater benefit from meditation training. Here, we tested whether the effect of mindfulness acquisition in mediating group differences in outcome was moderated by PAI scores. \nResults: A significant index of moderated mediation (IMM=1.22, 95% CI: 0.30, 2.33) revealed that the effect of mindfulness acquisition in mediating group differences in outcome was only significant among those individuals with PAI scores predicting relatively greater benefit from the meditation app. \nConclusions: Subgroups of individuals may differ meaningfully in the mechanisms that mediate their response to an intervention. Considering subgroup-specific mediators may accelerate progress on clarifying mechanisms of change underlying psychosocial interventions and may help inform which specific interventions are most beneficial for whom.","tags":["moderated mediation","mediation","moderation","meditation","mechanism","mobile health"],"date":"2023-01-05T15:36:20.681874","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychotherapy","Depressive Disorders","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3yswd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3yswd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3yswd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3yswd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_66"}

In this article, we propose a sample size-adjusted alpha level approach that combines the benefits of both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, enabling strict hypothesis testing with known error rates while also quantifying the evidence for a hypothesis. We present an R-package that can be used to set the sample size-adjusted alpha level for generalized linear models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression. This approach can help researchers stop relying on mindless defaults and avoid situations where they reject the null hypothesis when the evidence in the test actually favors the null hypothesis, improving the accuracy and robustness of statistical analysis in management research.","tags":["hypothesis testing","Bayesian-frequentist compromise","alpha level","significance testing"],"date":"2023-01-05T15:41:15.581152","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Statistical Methods","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3cbh7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3cbh7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3cbh7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3cbh7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_67"}

The current study modified the \u201cY-shaped tube task\u201d (Redshaw &amp; Suddendorf 2016) to test how the ability to distinguish mere possibilities from impossibilities emerges over ontogenesis. In the Y-shaped tube task, the experimenter holds a ball above a tube shaped like an upside-down \u201cY\u201d and asks a participant to catch it. A participant who identifies the two possible paths the ball can take should cover both exits at the bottom of the Y. But children might cover both exits without identifying both possibilities. For example, there are two good places to put hands, so they might just put one hand in each place. This does not require checking whether there is a path from the entrance to each exit. If children cover both exits because they have identified two possible paths for the ball, then they should differentiate exits where it is possible for the ball to come out from impossible exits, where there is no path from the entrance to the exit. Twenty-four 36-month-olds and 24 48-month-olds were tested. Fewer than 20% of 36-month-olds and only about half of 48-month-olds distinguished between possible and impossible exits. Children who don\u2019t distinguish the possible from the impossible may not be evaluating possibilities at all.

Here we showed that the sense of agency, as measured by intentional binding, decreased as participants learned through experience how long to wait before acting. Our findings suggest that the sense of agency depends on exploring the best course of action to achieve the goal, as opposed to simply exploiting knowledge about which action to select. Interestingly, this learning-related reduction in intentional binding occurred only when an imprecise target condition allowed participants to learn easily, and also when the action outcome was irrelevant to performance and therefore demanded little attention. Conversely, when action-outcome links were relevant and important, intentional binding remained high, and did not reduce with learning. Reductions in sense of agency with learning track the distinctive pattern of routinization of motor skills.","tags":["Sense of agency","Intentional Binding","Learning"],"date":"2023-01-05T16:08:09.442764","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x9fst\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x9fst\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x9fst","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x9fst","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_69"}
{"osf_id":"qfxr9","title":"The Role of Negative Affect in Shaping Populist Support: Converging Evidence from the Field","description":"Support for populism has risen substantially during the past two decades. We investigate the extent to which the rising electoral demand for populist parties and causes can be explained by negative affect. Globally, negative affect has risen rapidly in recent years and has even been referred to by some as a \"blind spot'' for politicians and policymakers who have failed to recognize its significance. We use a multi-modal, multi-method empirical approach, using data from a diverse set of geographical and political contexts. Across four studies, we demonstrate that negative affect \u2013 measured via self-reported emotions as well as automated text analyses of over 2 billion Tweets \u2013 predicts i) individual-level populist attitudes in global survey data (Studies 1a and 1b), ii) longitudinal changes in populist party vote shares at general elections in European countries (Study 2), iii) area-level Brexit voting in the 2016 UK referendum (Study 3) and iv) county-level vote shares for Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections (Studies 4a and 4b). We find that negative emotions\u2014such as fear and anger as well as more often overlooked low-arousal negative emotions like depression and sadness\u2014are predictive of populist beliefs as well as voting. We establish a boundary condition by demonstrating that the relationship does not hold for populist politicians who are already in power: Like other incumbents, governing populists do not benefit electorally when their constituents continue to experience negative affect after they have been elected. With negative affect being fertile ground for populist support, our research calls for politicians to alleviate rather than avail themselves of negative affect.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-05T19:02:50.016879","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Politics","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qfxr9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qfxr9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qfxr9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qfxr9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_70"}

Though studies of dog impulsivity have examined their inability to wait and to inhibit inappropriate behaviors, it is not clear whether impulsivity is a behavioral trait with consistent characteristics across contexts. For this project, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether impulsivity exists as a behavioral trait in domestic dogs. Under a pre-registered protocol, we processed over 10,000 bibliographic database records to uncover 13 articles with multiple impulsivity tasks assessed in the same subjects. Across 31 pairs of impulsivity tasks, 28 failed to detect a correlation in performance between tasks and 3 detected a correlation. For 15 correlations of impulsivity tasks with the owner's perception of their dog's impulsivity, 10 were not correlated, while 5 were correlated. A formal meta-analysis on one pair of tasks (A-not-B task and Cylinder task) tested across seven different studies showed no overall correlation between the tasks. Our systematic review and meta-analysis found little indication of consistent relationships between impulsivity levels across tasks for dogs. Therefore, at the moment, we do not have good evidence of impulsivity as a behavioral trait that transfers across contexts, suggesting that perhaps we should focus on the context-specific nature of impulsivity in dogs.","tags":["inhibitory control","dog","impulsivity","canine","meta-analysis","systematic review"],"date":"2023-01-05T22:54:58.648003","doi":"10.1037\/com0000352","subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Life Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Animal Learning and Behavior","Problem Solving","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ctfns\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ctfns\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ctfns","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ctfns","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/com0000352","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_72"}

To partially address these gaps, the present study sought to explore the effects of conceptual and analytical specification decisions (e.g., construct types, time, covariates) on observed control-well-being relationships in a large, age-diverse, longitudinal sample (Midlife in the United States I, II, and III datasets), providing a specification curve analysis (SCA) tutorial and guidance in the process. Results suggest that construct types and operationalizations, particularly predictor variables, have bearing on observed results, with certain types of control serving as better predictors of various forms of well-being than others.

Within the competitive gaming context, the meta represents the strategic and tactical knowledge that goes beyond the fundamental mechanics of the game, enabling players to gain a competitive advantage. We present a review of the state-of-the-art of knowledge for game metas and propose a novel model for the meta knowledge structure and propagation that accounts for this ecosystem, based on a review of the academic literature and practical examples.

We propose a computationally light linear model that can elucidate what factors people use during this sampling process, and whether they are optimal in doing so. We simulated agents using our model on expanded judgement tasks with different error cost (Study 1) and sampling cost (Study 2) scenarios to determine the optimal strategies in each condition. We then tested human participants in these scenarios to see if they behave optimally and if our model could capture their sampling decisions. We found that our model fit human data well and that people could shift their sampling strategy in an optimal direction when the cost of making an error changed. When sampling cost was manipulated, however, we observed a non-optimal shift in sampling strategy.

Accordingly, in contexts where choosing a partner that will provide resources is more beneficial (e.g., when resources are scarce), women have shown an increase preference for facial femininity in male faces. However, domains of scarcity often covary, and it is therefore unclear whether these contextual shifts in facial masculinity\/femininity preferences are specific to material scarcity (as implied by previous theory), or due to an unrelated domain of scarcity (e.g., time or psychological scarcity). Here, a sample of 823 women completed the Perceived Scarcity Scale, which measures three separate domains of scarcity: material scarcity, time scarcity, and psychological scarcity. Participants also rated the attractiveness of 42 male faces, which were measured on objective sexual dimorphism and perceived masculinity. Consistent with theory, material scarcity, and not time or psychological scarcity, was associated with a decreased preference for objective sexual dimorphism (i.e., an increased preference for facial femininity). This study provides evidence that women use sexual dimorphism as a cue to material resource provisioning potential when assessing men as a mate.","tags":["sexual dimorphism","mate preference","perceived scarcity","attraction","resource scarcity","individual differences"],"date":"2023-01-06T14:32:42.025131","doi":null,"subjects":["Mating","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3wntm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3wntm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3wntm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3wntm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_80"}

Cybersickness susceptibility varies across individuals, and previous research reported that interpupillary distance (IPD) may be a factor. However, that work emphasized cybersickness recovery rather than cybersickness immediately after exposure. The current study (N=178) examined if the mismatch between the user's IPD and the VR headset's IPD setting contributes to immediate cybersickness.

This raised important questions about how the autistic and autism communities perceive genomic research. The PEAPOD study was established to address this issue among a range of sub-groups within these communities.  \nMethods:  Twenty parents of nonverbal or minimally verbal autistic children took part. Data were provided in diverse formats including online interviews, telephone interviews and writing. This approach was co-produced with autistic experts by experience and involved a parent of a minimally verbal autistic child. Data were analysed using reflexive Thematic Analysis.\nResults:  Participants were supportive of autism research, including some genomic research, as long as it is designed to support autistic people and is ethical and transparent. However, while some believed that polygenic scores, genomic predictors of the statistical probability of being autistic, would be helpful, others argued that this would only be true in an ideal world. Participants felt excluded from the autistic and autism communities, and that the dominant voices in those communities do not represent them or their children.\nConclusion:  Genomic researchers need to work with the autistic and autism communities to design future work, and it is important to ensure a representative range of voices are heard.","tags":["minimally verbal","reflexive thematic analysis","nonverbal","GWAS","co-production","autism","genomics","polygenic scores","inclusion"],"date":"2023-01-06T14:58:59.411476","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nj5yh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nj5yh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nj5yh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nj5yh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_82"}

{"osf_id":"3ds84","title":"Judging Emotions as Good or Bad:  Individual Differences and Associations with Psychological Health","description":"People differ in their initial emotional responses to events, and we are beginning to understand these responses and their pervasive implications for psychological health. However, people also differ in how they think about and react to their initial emotions (i.e., emotion judgments). In turn, how people judge their emotions \u2013 as predominantly positive or negative \u2013 may have crucial implications for psychological health. Across five MTurk and undergraduate samples collected between 2017 and 2022 (total N=1,647), we investigated the nature of habitual emotion judgments (Aim 1) and their associations with psychological health (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we found four distinct habitual emotion judgments that differ according to the valence of the judgment (positive or negative) and the valence of the emotion being judged (positive or negative). Individual differences in habitual emotion judgments were moderately stable across time and were associated with, but not redundant with, conceptually related constructs (e.g., affect valuation, emotion preferences, stress mindsets, meta emotions) and broader traits (i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, trait emotions). In Aim 2, positive judgments of positive emotions were uniquely associated with better psychological health and negative judgments of negative emotions were uniquely associated with worse psychological health concurrently and prospectively, above and beyond the other types of emotion judgments, and above and beyond conceptually related constructs and broader traits. This research gives insight into how people judge their emotions, how these judgments relate to other emotion-related constructs, and their implications for psychological health.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-06T20:23:45.911834","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3ds84\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3ds84\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3ds84","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3ds84","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_84"}

We introduce a novel behavioral representational similarity analysis approach to index how semantic space is re-sculpted by episodic learning. Eighty participants learned word pairs that varied in semantic relatedness and whose learning was bolstered via either testing or restudying. Next-day recall was superior for semantically related pairs, but there was a larger benefit of testing for unrelated pairs. Critically, representations of cue words in semantically related pairs were drawn asymmetrically towards their targets, while cue and target representations in unrelated pairs were drawn together symmetrically. Testing additionally repelled semantic representations away from normative semantic space moreso than restudying. Taken together, we show that episodic learning can induce distortions of semantic space to improve later recall by making cues more predictive of targets, reducing interference from potential lures, and establishing elaborative links within pairs.","tags":["representational change","testing effect","semantic memory","episodic memory"],"date":"2023-01-06T20:35:43.384735","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8kq59\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8kq59\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8kq59","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8kq59","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_85"}

One promising approach to this fundamental question about consciousness is to intersubjectively compare the similarity relationships of sensory experiences, named \"qualia structures\". Conventional methods for comparing the similarity relationships largely sidestep the issue by assuming experiences evoked by the same stimuli are matched across individuals, precluding the possibility that my \"red\" might be your \"blue\". Here, we present an unsupervised optimal transport method for assessing the similarity of qualia structures without assuming correspondence between individuals. As proof of concept, we analyzed two massive datasets: dissimilarity judgments for 93 colors and 1854 natural objects. In both cases, we found that qualia structures can be \"correctly\" aligned across participants based solely on similarity relationships, providing quantitative evidence for the structural equivalence of qualia of color and natural objects across individuals. This method is applicable to any modality of experience, enabling general structural exploration of subjective experiences.","tags":["consciousness","color similarity","Gromov-Wasserstein distance","natural objects","qualia","THINGS","unsupervised alignment","optimal transport","qualia structure"],"date":"2023-01-07T14:02:08.183813","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h3pqm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h3pqm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h3pqm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h3pqm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_88"}

Replicating previous work, fact-checking statements led participants to update their beliefs, increasing belief after fact affirmations and decreasing belief for corrected misinformation, even for politically aligned material. After receiving fact-checks participants had reduced voting intentions and more negative feelings towards party-aligned politicians (likely due to low baseline support for opposing party politicians). For Brexit alignment the opposite was found: participants reduced their voting intentions and feelings for opposing (but not aligned) politicians following the fact-checks. These changes occurred regardless of the proportion of inaccurate statements, potentially indicating participants expect politicians to be accurate more than half the time. Finally, although we found division based on both party and Brexit alignment, effects were much stronger for party alignment, highlighting that even though new divisions have emerged in UK politics, the old divides remain dominant.","tags":["misinformation","fact-checking","political attitudes","Brexit","voting behaviour","belief change"],"date":"2023-01-08T01:08:09.863425","doi":"10.1098\/rsos.220508","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Politics","Attitudes and Persuasion","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rp9ty\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rp9ty\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rp9ty","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rp9ty","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1098\/rsos.220508","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_92"}

However, concerns have been raised that corrections may introduce false claims to new audiences when the misinformation is novel. This is because boosting the familiarity of a claim can increase belief in that claim, and thus exposing new audiences to novel misinformation\u2014even as part of a correction\u2014may inadvertently increase misinformation belief. Such an outcome could be conceptualized as a familiarity backfire effect, whereby a familiarity boost increases false-claim endorsement above a control-condition or pre-correction baseline. Here, we examined whether standalone corrections\u2014that is, corrections presented without initial misinformation exposure\u2014can backfire and increase participants\u2019 reliance on the misinformation in their subsequent inferential reasoning, relative to a no-misinformation, no-correction control condition. Across three experiments (total N\u2009=\u20091156) we found that standalone corrections did not backfire immediately (Experiment 1) or after a one-week delay (Experiment 2). However, there was some mixed evidence suggesting corrections may backfire when there is skepticism regarding the correction (Experiment 3). Specifically, in Experiment 3, we found the standalone correction to backfire in open-ended responses, but only when there was skepticism towards the correction. However, this did not replicate with the rating scales measure. Future research should further examine whether skepticism towards the correction is the first replicable mechanism for backfire effects to occur.","tags":["misinformation","skepticism","familiarity backfire effect","corrections"],"date":"2023-01-08T01:52:25.946162","doi":"10.1186\/s41235-023-00492-z","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory","Reasoning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u7s2b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/u7s2b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/u7s2b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u7s2b","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s41235-023-00492-z","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_93"}

What makes solitude more acceptable depends on what activities the person is performing, which gender the person is, and what stages of life they are in. Secondly, the physical environment can influence how solitude is perceived and experienced. Solitude is perceived more positively in spaces with less social intrusion and fewer safety concerns, particularly for women being alone in public spaces. Finally, the third theme identified that perceptions and experiences of solitude vary across the lifespan. Solitude and solo experiences are typically portrayed as more maladaptive and unfavourable earlier in life, while these experiences become more tolerable and enjoyable in older age.\u202fOverall, findings from this review suggest that research into solitude should ensure solitary experiences are viewed within the societal and physical contexts in which they occur.","tags":["norms","physical environment","lifespan","solo experiences","solitude"],"date":"2023-01-08T10:50:52.551057","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xb8gd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xb8gd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xb8gd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xb8gd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_95"}

Several studies demonstrate that SoA is modulated when the outcomes are affective. However, the research on the influence of emotional outcomes on SoA have yielded somewhat contradictory results. Some studies suggest that the SoA is increased when the outcomes are positive while others conversely suggest that it is diminished compared to negative outcomes, specifically in a moral or social context. This study examined the influence of outcome valence on SoA with a temporal binding paradigm, by manipulating emotional valence and outcome delays. Participants chose between two actions with key presses which randomly produced one of positive (happy), negative (sad) or neutral emoticons after varying delays and judged the interval between their key press and the outcome. The results revealed a significant interaction between outcome valence and delay, which suggested that specifically at 500 ms of delay, perceived intervals were reliably shorter (i.e., stronger binding) between key presses and negative outcomes compared to positive outcomes. Our findings suggest that a negative valence might improve an individual's capacity for SoA when they are presented with an action choice and are unable to predict the outcomes in a social-emotional environment.","tags":["sense of agency","action outcome","intentional binding","emotional valence","postdictive"],"date":"2023-01-08T14:07:17.898745","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Consciousness","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s4c6j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s4c6j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s4c6j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s4c6j","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_96"}

We illustrate this approach by focusing on a body of research already meta-analyzed by one of us, whose overall aim is to assess if human infants possess an intuitive moral sense.

{"osf_id":"e56tm","title":"Boosting self-regulated learning with mobile interventions: Planning and prompting help children maintain a regular study routine","description":"Mobile technologies offer new opportunities for encouraging self-regulated learning (SRL) in children. In this pre-registered study, we tested what kind of mobile intervention helps children maintain a regular study routine for vocabulary learning. Study behavior was measured objectively and with high ecological validity using logfiles of a vocabulary app that the children used. The mobile intervention was delivered via a separate study app and combined two critical components: planning and prompting. Children (N = 130, mean age = 10.75 years) first received a digital instruction on the benefits of distributed practice. Children in the full intervention group also formulated a plan for when and where to learn vocabulary. On about half of the next 36 days (within-subject manipulation), they received prompts reminding them of the instruction and the plan. The comparison groups lacked either the prompting or planning intervention component (between-person manipulation). The results revealed that the reminder prompts increased the likelihood of studying on the day they were given. Planning, in contrast, had a more long-term impact in that it helped children maintain a high frequency of learning over time. Overall, our findings show that mobile interventions can be highly effective in supporting SRL in children. We discuss the results in light of theoretical assumptions about the different mechanisms underlying planning and prompting effects, and highlight the practical importance of finding the optimal frequency of prompting.","tags":["implementation intentions","if-then plans","mobile learning","prompting","vocabulary learning","self-regulated learning"],"date":"2023-01-09T09:35:47.601145","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e56tm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/e56tm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/e56tm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e56tm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_99"}
{"osf_id":"ak3d7","title":"Designing an app to enhance children's planning skills:  A case for personalized technology","description":"Planning is an important but difficult self-regulation strategy. The successful implementation of a plan requires that the plan is retrievable in everyday life when it is needed. Children in particular are unlikely to use effective strategies to internalize plans in a way that makes them easy to remember. Therefore, we designed PROMPT, a planning app to help children create and internalize plans effectively. The app included different internalization activities that were hypothesized to promote deeper or shallower processing of plans. School-aged children (N = 106, 9-14 years) used PROMPT for 27 days in their daily lives. Contrary to our hypotheses, the type of internalization activity was not associated with memory success overall. Deeper processing activities were only effective for children who spent more time performing these activities, suggesting that there were differences in how effectively children could make use of the internalization activities. These individual differences were predicted by children\u2019s grade level and their analogical reasoning abilities, and mediated by time on task. Findings suggest that a child-appropriate planning app needs to be personalized to be effective; internalization activities have to be tailored to children\u2019s learning prerequisites.","tags":["implementation intentions","planning","internalization","mobile application","individual differences","personalized technology"],"date":"2023-01-09T09:44:44.779479","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ak3d7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ak3d7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ak3d7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ak3d7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_100"}

First, operational definitions and contents of gain-framing and loss-framing, as well as often overlooked nonloss framing and nongain framing, have been unclear and sometimes confusing, with contradictory findings comparing these conditions. Moreover, there have been mixed and null findings in risk and message framing, a few null findings in the relatively robust regulatory fit literature, and concerns regarding generalizability of findings especially regarding age and culture. I discuss these issues, report an Open-Meta-Science assessment on the health message framing literature, and propose possible solutions to each of these problems.

Existing evidence indicates that people with dysmenorrhea often engage in presenteeism, meaning they work despite experiencing symptoms and report perceptions of social stigma around menstruation. In this study, we investigated individual health-related factors, psychosocial factors, and work factors associated with period pain presenteeism in a cross-sectional survey study including N = 668 employed people with experiences of dysmenorrhea. Our results show that symptom severity, disclosure of menstrual pain to the leader, and remote work are directly associated with period pain presenteeism. We further found that the presence of medical diagnosis moderates the association between symptom severity and presenteeism. Disclosure to the leader was associated with leader gender, leader-member exchange (LMX), and the absence of a medical diagnosis, indicating a potential mediating effect. We did not, however, find the perceptions of public beliefs regarding the concealment of menstruation to be related to presenteeism or disclosure. Our findings have important implications for research on menstrual health and occupational health management practice.","tags":["illness disclosure","presenteeism","gender diversity","pain","dysmenorrhea","menstruation"],"date":"2023-01-09T13:14:02.224073","doi":null,"subjects":["Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Occupational Health","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h5cfm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h5cfm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h5cfm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h5cfm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_102"}

{"osf_id":"pfnzd","title":"How does the phrasing of house edge information affect gamblers\u2019 perceptions and level of understanding? A Registered Report","description":"The provision of information to consumers is a common input to tackling various public health issues. By comparison to the information given on food and alcohol products, information on gambling products is either not given at all, or shown in low-prominence locations in a suboptimal format, e.g., the \u201creturn-to-player\u201d format, \u201cthis game has an average percentage payout of 90%\u201d. Some previous research suggests that it would be advantageous to communicate this information via the \u201chouse edge\u201d format instead: the average loss from a given gambling product, e.g., \u201cthis game keeps 10% of all money bet on average\u201d. However, previous empirical work on the house edge format only uses this specific phrasing, and there may be better ways of communicating house edge information. The present work experimentally tested this original phrasing of the house edge against an alternative phrasing that has also been proposed, \u201con average this game is programmed to cost you 10% of your stake on each bet\u201d, while both phrasings were also compared against equivalent return-to-player information (N = 3,333 UK-based online gamblers).

Preregistered Stage 1 protocol: https:\/\/osf.io\/5npy9 (date of in-principle acceptance: 28\/11\/2022). The alternative house edge phrasing resulted in the lowest perceived chances of winning, but the original phrasing had the highest rate of correct understanding. Compared to return-to-player information, the original phrasing had both lower perceived chances of winning and higher rates of correct understanding, while the alternative phrasing had only lower perceived chances of winning. These results replicated prior work on the advantages of the original house edge phrasing over return-to-player information, while showing that the alternative house edge phrasing has advantageous properties for gamblers\u2019 perceived chances of winning only. The optimal communication of risk information can act as an input to a public health approach to reducing gambling-related harm.","tags":["Public health","open science","risk information","gambling"],"date":"2023-01-09T13:50:22.768181","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pfnzd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pfnzd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pfnzd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pfnzd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_104"}

In Experiment 1, we tested the effect of background music on memory when it was played solely during an encoding phase. In Experiment 2, we explored effects of background music when played during both encoding and recognition phases. In Experiment 3, we explored the role of musically induced arousal on memory. \nResults: The main finding from these three experiments was that background music played during a memory task did not improve or worsen participant performance.  However, when exposed to high-arousal music, memory performance was predicted by individual mood regulation. For low-arousal music conditions, there was a negative relationship between rating scores for music pleasantness and performance on the memory task.\t\nConclusions: Our results suggest that the benefits of background music on memory in individuals with MCI are modulated by interindividual preferences towards music.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-09T14:30:39.389331","doi":null,"subjects":["Neuroscience","Music","Behavioral Neuroscience","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6xawp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6xawp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6xawp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6xawp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_105"}

In our model, the parameters modulating learning adjust optimally according to the information on outcomes. Their values are modulated by the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. When feedback is complete, exploration is redundant, and parameters adjust to maximize exploitation. When feedback is partial (only provided on the chosen option) an optimal compromise is reached between exploration and exploitation. \n\nWe test these predictions in a set of experiments with complete and partial feedback. We find support for the hypothesis that coding is adaptive, and has the linear form we hypothesize. The design allows us to discriminate between two possible formulations, finding support for the hypothesis that adaptation is specific to reward encoding.  We also find that the representational bias introduced in choice by the adaptive coding is transitory and is corrected when appropriate information is provided to participants.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-09T15:27:24.059795","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Reasoning","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7ghx6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7ghx6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7ghx6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7ghx6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_107"}

Many researchers and practitioners expect bCBT to be advantageous for treating mental disorders such as depression. Yet, studies comparing bCBT to non-blended face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are limited and have yielded heterogeneous results. Thus, this pilot study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of a novel bCBT digital therapeutic for treating unipolar depression in adults combined with face-to-face CBT compared to face-to-face CBT alone (treatment as usual; TAU) in routine care. Patients (N = 80) were randomly assigned to bCBT (n = 41) or standard CBT (n = 39) over 12 weeks. bCBT consisted of weekly face-to-face CBT sessions accompanied by the digital therapeutic elona therapy for use between sessions. Standard CBT consisted of weekly face-to-face CBT sessions, mirroring routine care. A broad set of outcomes were measured at baseline, at six weeks, and at 12 weeks. These outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed models. Improvements in depressive symptoms were descriptively larger for the bCBT group than for the CBT group (BDI-II: d = -.22, PHQ-9: d = -.27). Yet, this difference did not reach statistical significance. bCBT was superior to standard CBT in secondary outcome measures of psychological health (d = .54) and generalized anxiety symptoms (d = -.50). In other secondary outcomes, improvements were also descriptively larger for bCBT than for CBT, but these differences did not reach statistical significance (BAI: d = -.28, PSWQ: d = .28, GSE: d = .31, WHOQOL-BREF physical health scale: d = .28). In sum, this pilot study indicated that bCBT is superior to standard CBT and safe to use in clinical samples.

{"osf_id":"spfqx","title":"Relative syllable duration and pitch alignment in the Spanish of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina","description":"In C\u00f3rdoba Spanish, speech has been hypothesized to consist of wide f0 range and a lengthened pre-tonic syllable in nuclear (phrase-final, accented) position. Proposed correlates of pre-tonic lengthening are analyzed in read and conversational speech, and visual analyses of f0 contours are conducted across both speech styles. In Study 1, speakers recited three repetitions of 40 utterances in which the number of pre-tonic syllables in target words and the prosodic position of those targets were manipulated. Study 2 investigates the same variables in a corpus of informal conversation. The results support many claims made in previous, impressionistic studies: C\u00f3rdoba Spanish possesses lengthened pre-tonic syllables in which f0 range increases as does lengthening. However, the length discrepancy between the pre-tonic and the tonic vowels is greatest in pre-nuclear rather than nuclear position. This is attributed to phrase-final lengthening of the tonic\u2014but not the pre-tonic\u2014syllable, which provides evidence that lexical stress is at most weakly correlated to duration in this variety.

Such evidence can help inform understanding of need for psychosis care.\n\nMethods: We conducted a prospectively-registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021245891) following PRISMA guidelines. We searched four databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Embase) for papers containing incidence data on non-organic psychotic disorders, published between 1950-2021 in the general adult population. We conducted duplicate screening, risk of bias assessments, and extracted data to a standardised template. We undertook a narrative synthesis for each major diagnostic outcome. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted for comparisons with \u22655 incidence rates.\n\nResults: Our search yielded 1,975 non-duplicate citations, of which 23 met inclusion criteria, containing incidence data ascertained between 1974 and 2016 (median study quality: 5\/8; interquartile range: 4-6). Incidence of all psychotic disorders (N=4 studies) varied from 22.0 (95%CI: 17.3-28.0) in Dublin to 34.1 per 100,000 person-years (95%CI: 31.0-37.5) in Cavan and Monaghan. The pooled incidence of schizophrenia (N=6 studies, N=8 settings) was 20.0 per 100,000 person-years, though with imprecision around this estimate (95%CI: 10.6-37.5; I2: 97.6%). Higher rates of most outcomes were observed in men. There was consistent evidence of raised rates in more deprived and fragmented social environments, but no clear pattern by rural-urban status. \n\nConclusions: Patterns of incidence of psychotic disorders in Ireland are broadly consistent with the wider literature from the Global North. These findings could help to identify populations at higher risk of developing psychotic disorder in Ireland.","tags":["mental health","psychosis","epidemiology","incidence","schizophrenia","Ireland","meta-analysis","systematic review","Republic of Ireland","psychotic disorders"],"date":"2023-01-09T19:00:25.826104","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dhfys\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/dhfys\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/dhfys","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dhfys","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_113"}

The present work tests whether intergroup attitudes and behaviors are motivated by ingroup positivity, outgroup negativity, or both, across the first few years of life. In two studies (total N = 128), children were introduced to an ingroup doll and an outgroup doll, and interacted with each one independently in a resource allocation task. Toddlers showed both ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity (Study 1). Preschoolers shifted from this pattern, showing positivity and avoiding negativity toward both ingroup and outgroup members (Study 2). Together, these studies suggest that outgroup negativity plays a stronger role in motivating early intergroup bias than previously thought.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-09T19:41:57.594272","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m6y8q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/m6y8q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/m6y8q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m6y8q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_114"}
{"osf_id":"wcbt4","title":"Usually, I don\u2019t ruminate, only from time to time: the predictive value of trait and state measures of rumination for the intensity of affective states","description":"Emotions and their flexible regulation are essential in adapting to our environment. Individuals differ significantly in their ability to regulate their emotions, and research has traditionally focused on these individual differences. However, evidence emerges that traditional laboratory measures and questionnaires capturing trait emotion regulation may not correspond to emotion regulation ability in real life as assessed by repeated measures designs. These processes appear to show different variability between and within individuals, implying that characteristics regarded as traits in psychology \u2013 e.g., emotion regulation effectiveness and typical use of strategies \u2013 may not reflect everyday functioning.\n\nOne of the most extensively researched emotion regulation strategies is rumination, a cognitive process that involves repeatedly and passively dwelling on negative feelings and their consequences. Interestingly, recent results suggest only a weak correlation between state and trait measures of rumination. Furthermore, evidence supports that increased state (but not trait) rumination is associated with higher emotional reactivity, the emotional reactions experienced in response to a negative occurrence. However, based on the evidence described above, the temporal, within-person examination of rumination may predict emotional reactivity even more accurately.\n\nThe present study aims to confirm that within-person, state measures of rumination hold a more substantial predictive value for emotional reactivity compared to between-person trait rumination. We also investigated the association between state and trait rumination in this longitudinal study.\n\nThe sample comprised 247 individuals who provided data for 28 days in an experience sampling method (ESM) study. Participants received 8 short, discretional questionnaires daily, assessing their momentary affective states, emotion regulation, and perceived stress. 14265 observations were obtained, then analyzed using mixed-effects models.\n\nOur results suggested that all state, aggregated mean state, and trait measures have independent predictive validity for emotional reactivity. However, the magnitude of these effects overlapped, and therefore, the importance of the measures could not be ranked. On the other hand, when negative affect alone was considered, the mean of state measures of rumination emerged as the strongest predictor. This composite indicator can essentially be considered a trait measure to some degree, however, it incorporates the everyday variability of the process within an individual, thus differing from traditional, self-report trait measures that can be subject to recall bias and lower ecological validity. Thus, it could be regarded as a measurement \u2018halfway between\u2019 trait and state indicators that could possibly combine the advantages of both, thereby having the best incremental validity in terms of predicting emotional reactivity.\n\nFurthermore, we found only a moderate positive correlation between trait and state rumination indicators. Certain psychometric and contextual differences could account for this result, as well as the different self-report techniques tapping different sources of self-related information.\n\nOur findings provide valuable insight for understanding the within-individual dynamics of emotion regulation and their relationship to stress and affectivity, nuancing the common trait approach and overcoming some of its limitations. Thereby, our results corroborate the need to re-evaluate the traditional measurement of psychological constructs. Additionally, our findings have clinically relevant, practical implications for the personalized prediction of emotional responses to stress through simple self-report tools applicable in everyday contexts.","tags":["rumination","stress","time-series data","emotional reactivity","affective states","emotion","trait vs. state","emotion regulation","experience sampling method","ecological momentary assessment","mixed-effects modeling"],"date":"2023-01-09T20:33:09.558710","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Stress","Cognitive Psychology","Individual Differences","Health Psychology","Mental Health","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Trait Theory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wcbt4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wcbt4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wcbt4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wcbt4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_115"}

However, learning may also proceed by systems alignment in which mappings are inferred between systems, such as visual and linguistic systems. Systems alignment is possible because items that share similar visual contexts, such as a car and a truck, will also tend to share similar linguistic contexts. Because of the mirrored similarity relationships, the visual and linguistic systems and can be aligned at some later time absent either input. We considered whether children's early concepts are learned by systems alignment. We found that children's early concepts are close to optimal for inferring novel concepts through system alignment. Structurally, children's early concepts are distinguished by their dense semantic neighbourhoods. Artificial agents using these structural features were highly effective, including in domains that exclude children's early concepts. For children, system alignment and event-based learning appear complementary.

What is the nature of this core mental process? Although this question is at the center of scientific research on perception, it has also long been explored by philosophers, who ask fundamental questions about our capacity to perceive: Do our different senses represent the world in commensurable ways? How much of our environment can we be aware of at one time? Which aspects of perception are \u2018objective\u2019, and which \u2018subjective\u2019? What properties count as perceptual in the first place? Although these parallel research programs typically proceed independently in contemporary scholarship, previous eras recognized more active collaboration and interaction across philosophical and scientific approaches to perception. Here, we review an emerging research focus that has begun to reunite these approaches, by putting several long-standing philosophical questions to empirical test. Unlike more general sources of philosophical inspiration, the work described here draws a direct line from a prominent philosophical conjecture or thought experiment about perception to a key test of that question in the laboratory\u2014such that the relevant experimental work would not (and even could not) have proceeded as it did without the preceding philosophical discussion. Finally, we explore themes arising from these successful interactions, and point to further philosophical questions that might be amenable to empirical approaches.","tags":["interdisciplinary work","perception","vision science","psychology","philosophy","empirical philosophy"],"date":"2023-01-09T23:11:40.907468","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Vision","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9mskz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9mskz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9mskz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9mskz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_118"}

When time permits, people appear to approach these goal prioritization problems by analytically considering all goal-relevant information to arrive at a prioritization decision. However, it is not yet clear if this normative strategy extends to situations characterized by resource constraints such as when deliberation time is scarce or cognitive load is high. We evaluated the questions of how limited deliberation time and cognitive load affect goal prioritization decisions across a series of experiments using a gamified experimental task, which required participants to make a series of interdependent goal prioritization decisions. We fit several candidate models to experimental data to identify decision strategy adaptations at the individual subject-level. Results indicated that participants tended to opt for a simple heuristic strategy when cognitive resources were constrained rather than making a general tradeoff between speed and accuracy (e.g., the type of tradeoff that would be predicted by evidence accumulation models). The most common heuristic strategy involved disproportionately weighing information about goal deadlines compared to other goal-relevant information such as the goal\u2019s difficulty and the goal\u2019s subjective value.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-09T23:25:46.552599","doi":"10.1016\/j.cogpsych.2023.101618","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pkv7u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pkv7u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pkv7u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pkv7u","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cogpsych.2023.101618","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_119"}

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition that affects children, and its severity differs significantly. The word spectrum used shows how symptoms vary from one child to another, whereby some have severe symptoms, with others having mild signs of the disease. The symptoms of ASD have been characterized by two distinct categories, which include social interaction and communication problems alongside repetitive patterns of activities or behaviors. ASD has no cure; however, several approaches and interventions have been developed to assist these children in dealing with the condition. There are four distinct types of therapies and approaches to helping those with ASD, these include medication, dietary approaches, alternative and complementary medicine, and, lastly, behavior and communications interventions. Research has shown that parents have overwhelming stress when their child is diagnosed with ASD. ASD among children has inflicted profound stress on parents, and counseling should be offered to them before the situation turns worst.","tags":["Autism Spectrum Disorder","ASD Treatments","Neurological and Developmental disabilities","ASD","Dietary Approaches","Review Article","Parental Stress Involved","ASD Symptoms","Communication and Behavior Approaches"],"date":"2023-01-10T02:35:24.520589","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development","Physiology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v6qb2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/v6qb2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/v6qb2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v6qb2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_120"}
{"osf_id":"wrtb6","title":"Conditional Process Analysis for Two-Instance Repeated-Measures Designs","description":"Conditional process models are commonly used in psychological science, allowing researchers to better understand how processes depend moderating variables. Methodological developments in conditional process analysis have focused on the analysis of data collected using between-subject designs. However, another common design is the two-instance repeated-measures design, where each subject is measured twice: once in each of two instances. Research on how to statistically test mediation, moderation, and conditional process models in these designs has lagged behind. Judd, Kenny, and McClelland (2001) introduced a piecewise method for testing for mediation, and Montoya and Hayes (2017) translated this method to a path-analytic approach, allowing for a quantification of the indirect effect, more sophisticated methods of inference, and the extension to multiple mediator models. Moderation analysis in these designs has been described by Judd, McClelland, and Smith (1996), Judd et al. (2001), and Montoya (2018). However, the generalization to conditional process analysis, models where some part of a mediation is moderated, remains incomplete. I propose a general conditional process model for two-instance repeated-measures designs with one moderator and one mediator. Simplifications of this general model correspond to more commonly used moderated mediation models, such as first-stage and second-stage conditional process analysis. Two applied examples show both how to conduct the analysis using MEMORE, a free and easy to use macro for SPSS and SAS, and how to interpret the results of such an analysis. Alternative methods for evaluating moderated mediation in two-instance repeated measures designs including multilevel and structural equation modeling approaches are discussed.","tags":["moderated mediation","moderation analysis","conditional process analysis","repeated-measures designs","mediation analysis"],"date":"2023-01-10T04:08:40.476571","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Quantitative Psychology","Experimental Design and Sample Surveys","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wrtb6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wrtb6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wrtb6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wrtb6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_121"}

Exposed to identical punishment contingencies, some people (Sensitive) form correct causal beliefs that guide their behaviour to avoid punishment, whereas others form incorrect causal beliefs that lead them to earn punishment. Incorrect causal beliefs were not inherently problematic, many individuals benefited from information about why punishment was occurring, revaluing their actions and changing their behaviour (Unaware). However, we identify one condition where incorrect causal beliefs can be problematic: when punishment is infrequent. Under this condition, more individuals showed detrimental patterns of behaviour that resisted information-driven updating (Compulsive).

{"osf_id":"gfuet","title":"The Relationship between Plasticity in the Primary Visual Cortex and the Hallucinatory Persisting Perception Disorder","description":"The Hallucinatory Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a distressing condition associated with the consumption of hallucinatory drugs, especially psychedelics. Its symptoms include abnormal visual perceptions, hallucinations, and depersonalization\/derealisation. They can appear after repetitive use of a psychoactive substance as well as after the first experience, and can last for a short period or for the entire life. It is currently not well understood how common HPPD is, or what are the mechanisms behind it. However, much research has been conducted on the processes behind plasticity in the primary visual cortex, both during development and in adulthood, and recent studies have provided some insights into how psychedelics work on the brain. It is then possible now to try and link the different pieces of information concerning plasticity in the visual cortex, psychedelics, and HPPD. With the recent increase in interest and attention surrounding psychedelics, the number of people experimenting with these substances has increased. As a result, it is important for research on HPPD and its potential relationship with psychedelics to continue, as well as for accurate information about the potential risks and effects of using psychedelics to be widely disseminated. The first part of this article describes the mechanisms behind the critical period for vision, and the plasticity of the visual system during development and adulthood. This part, which includes the first three paragraphs, has been adapted from my master\u2019s thesis (Scarlatti, 2021).

Relatively few studies focused on the prestimulus interval and found that stronger expectations are associated with lower prestimulus alpha power. However, alpha power also fluctuates spontaneously, in absence of experimental manipulations; and in the attention and perception domains, spontaneously low prestimulus power is associated with better behavioral performance and with ERPs with shorter latencies and higher amplitudes Importantly, little is known about the role of alpha fluctuations in other domains, as it is in language. To this aim, we investigated whether spontaneous fluctuations in prestimulus alpha power modulate language-related ERPs in a semantic congruence task. EEG data were analyzed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models to model non-linear interactions between prestimulus alpha power and EEG amplitude, at the single-trial level. We found that the N400 and the late posterior positivity\/P600 were larger in the case of lower prestimulus alpha power. Still, while the N400 was observable regardless of the level of prestimulus power, a late posterior positivity\/P600 effect was only observable for low prestimulus alpha power. We discuss these findings in light of the different, albeit connected, functional interpretations of prestimulus alpha and the ERPs according to both a non-predictive interpretation focused on attentional mechanisms and under a predictive processing framework.","tags":["late posterior positivity\/P600","N400","linguistic violation","prestimulus alpha power","language"],"date":"2023-01-10T10:24:14.070970","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f96a4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/f96a4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/f96a4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f96a4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_125"}

{"osf_id":"ux3yc","title":"Determinants of face recognition: the role of target prevalence and similarity","description":"Studies of facial identity processing typically assess perception and\/or recognition, with designs differing with respect to one important aspect: Target Prevalence. That is, some include \u201ctarget absent\u201d (TA) among \u201ctarget present\u201d (TP) trials. In visual search tasks, TA trials shift an observer\u2019s decisional criterion towards a stricter one, increasing error rates. However, decisional biases will differ inter-individually and can change intra-individually as well. From one standpoint, excluding TA trials is logical as it ensures comparable levels of expectation, or decisional bias across observers, and tasks. However, in reality, TA trials may occur, e.g. in police line-ups, where it is important to consider observers\u2019 face recognition ability independently for TA and TP trials. To our knowledge, the effect of including TA trials has not been systematically investigated in tests of face recognition.

To this end, we ran a study with a three-factor mixed design with relationship type (couples vs. strangers) and age (older adults vs. younger adults) as between-participants variables, and remembering condition (collaborative vs. individual) as a within-participants variable. Thirty pairs of intimate couples (fifteen long-term relationship older couples, fifteen short-term relationship younger couples) and thirty pairs of corresponding stranger-pairs(including older strangers and younger strangers) were compared with respect to recall accuracy and conversation dynamics, specifically considering the role of gender. Results revealed significant collaborative facilitation only in older couples. Also, females\u2019 communication behaviors facilitated males\u2019 collaborative remembering performance only in older (vs. younger) couples. In addition, a gender-specific pattern of shifts from the individual to collaborative context emerged only in older couple (vs. strangers). The findings are consistent with the notion that a longer experience of collaboration and more effective conversation dynamics allow older (vs. younger) couples to perform better at collaborative remembering.

One of the many changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic is a shift to virtual and remote learning opportunities. Just as parents, students, and teachers had to adjust to the virtual and hybrid classrooms, so too must researchers adapt their methods and research strategies to work in this new context. Here, we present our experiences conducting behavioral assessments in remote environments. We discuss the challenges presented in a fully virtual environment when neither the teachers nor researchers can physically interact with students, and contrast that with a hybrid environment in which researchers were remote, but teachers and students were together in their physical classroom. By sharing our experiences and insights into how to conduct research with students remotely, we aim to encourage more researchers to take advantage of this new avenue of research that has the potential to increase participation for populations geographically farther from the research team at a lower cost of effort for the research team, which can particularly help increase participation from underrepresented groups.","tags":["school-based research","research design","remote research"],"date":"2023-01-10T15:27:29.574510","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vtj4d\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vtj4d\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vtj4d","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vtj4d","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_130"}

Examining emotion regulation in the context of a sense of purpose in life opens portals to new questions and testable hypotheses.

This is the first study that created developmental scales for both internalizing and externalizing problems by putting scores from different informants and measures onto the same scale to examine temperament facets as risk factors. Multidimensional linking allowed us to examine trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from ages 2 to 15 years (N = 1,364) using near-annual ratings by mothers, fathers, teachers, other caregivers, and self-report. We examined reactive and control processes in early childhood as predictors of the trajectories and as predictors of general versus specific psychopathology in adolescence. Negative emotionality at age 4 predicted general psychopathology and unique externalizing problems at age 15. Wait times on an immediacy preference task at age 4 were negatively associated with age 15 general psychopathology, and positively associated with unique internalizing problems.

It is therefore important to understand the relationship between attitudes and intelligibility before introducing RM in Frysl\u00e2n. To investigate this relationship, overt and covert attitudes of 34 Dutch-speaking adults were measured (Mage = 34) via a survey containing a Matched Guise Test (MGT), and intelligibility was tested via a cloze test. It was expected that negative attitudes caused a lower intelligibility. The data suggests a significant effect of covert attitudes on intelligibility and a near-significant effect of overt attitudes on intelligibility.

Investigating these age-related differences requires numerous methodological decisions, resulting in pipelines of great variation. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of different analytical pipelines on the age-related differences in P3 latencies in real data. Therefore, we conducted an explorative multiverse study and varied the low-pass filter (4 Hz, 8 Hz, 16 Hz, 32 Hz, and no filter), the latency type (area vs. peak), the level of ERP analysis (single participant vs. jackknifing) and the extraction method (manual vs. automated). 30 young (18 \u2013 21 years) and 30 old (50 \u2013 60 years) participants completed three tasks (Nback task, Switching task, Flanker task) while an EEG was recorded.\nThe results show that different analysis strategies can have a tremendous impact on the detection and magnitude of the age effect, with effect sizes ranging from 0% to 88% explained variance. Likewise, regarding the psychometric properties of P3 latencies, we found that the reliabilities fluctuated between rtt = .20 and 1.00, while the homogeneities ranged from rh = -.12 to .90. Based on predefined criteria, we found that the most effective pipelines relied on a manual extraction based on a single participant's data. For peak latencies, manual extraction performed well for all filters except for 4 Hz, while for area latencies, filters above 8 Hz produced desirable results. Furthermore, our findings add to the evidence that jackknifing combined with peak latencies can lead to inconclusive results.","tags":["latency","P3","ERP","multiverse analysis","age","jackknifing"],"date":"2023-01-10T18:50:40.688511","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Physiology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pfza5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pfza5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pfza5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pfza5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_135"}

Likewise, SEM indices of model fit, such as CFI and RMSEA also perform inconsistently and unreliably. Despite rather unreliable ways to statistically assess model fit, researchers commonly rely on these methods for lack of a suitable inferential alternative. Marcoulides and Yuan (2017) have proposed the first inferential test of SEM fit in many years: an equivalence test adaptation of the RMSEA and CFI indices (i.e., RMSEAt and CFIt). However, the ability of this equivalence testing approach to accurately judge acceptable and unacceptable model fit has not been empirically tested. This fully-crossed Monte Carlo simulation evaluated the accuracy of equivalence testing combining many of the same IV conditions used in previous fit index simulation studies, including: sample size (N = 100-1000), model specification (correctly-specified or misspecified), model type (CFA, path analysis, or SEM), number of variables analyzed (low or high), data distribution (normal or skewed), and missing data (none, 10%, or 25%). Results show equivalence testing performs rather inconsistently and unreliably across IV conditions, with acceptable or unacceptable RMSEAt and CFIt model fit index values often being contingent on complex interactions among conditions. Proportional z-tests and logistic regression analyses indicated that equivalence tests of model fit are problematic under multiple conditions, especially those where models are mildly misspecified. Recommendations for researchers are offered, but with the provision that they be used with caution until more research is available.","tags":["simulation","equivalence testing","mplus","Monte Carlo simulation","statistical model fit","R","model fit"],"date":"2023-01-10T23:06:24.358050","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yf3qz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yf3qz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yf3qz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yf3qz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_139"}

Emerging evidence suggests that analyzing language (i.e., the words people use) can grant insight into one\u2019s emotional experiences, their ability to regulate their emotions, and even their current experiences of psychopathology. As such, linguistic analyses of people\u2019s everyday word use may be a diagnostic marker of emotional well-being, and manipulating the words people use could foster adaptive emotion regulation and mental health. Such language-based tools for measuring and intervening on emotion and mental health have the potential to drastically revolutionize how we identify and treat mental illnesses at a large scale. In this paper, I outline the promise of this vision and identify key problems we must solve if we are to make it a reality. In particular, I summarize evidence connecting language, emotion, and mental health for three key constructs: sentiment (i.e., the valence of one\u2019s language), linguistic distancing (i.e., using language to separate oneself from distressing stimuli), and emotion differentiation (i.e., using words to specifically identify one\u2019s emotions).

As one of the most intractable and severe psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia showed deficits on multiple social cognitive domains. In particular, interpersonal coordination failures in schizophrenia are closely linked to significant prognostic indicators, such as symptom remission and quality of life. Despite the surge of interest in the psychological and neural mechanisms of interpersonal coordination in schizophrenia, important gaps in our understanding remain. Notably, the study of the mechanisms underpinning interpersonal coordination is currently undergoing a methodological shift, moving its focus from single-person tasks to multi-person paradigms, and from model-free analyses to model-based analyses. Notwithstanding, applications of these advanced approaches in schizophrenia has been slow. Here, we provide a concise update on the uses of multi-person paradigms to study interpersonal coordination and mathematical models to dissect its computational mechanisms, at both behavioral and neural levels. We then review prior studies on the interpersonal coordination deficits in schizophrenia and large-scale neuroimaging studies that explore brain correlates of social functions. Finally, we highlight key challenges as well as exciting opportunities for integrating research in computational psychiatry with multi-person approaches in investigating interpersonal coordination deficits in schizophrenia.","tags":["neuroimage","social functioning","interpersonal coordination","computational psychiatry","schizophrenia"],"date":"2023-01-11T11:52:01.765601","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Psychotic Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5hevc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5hevc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5hevc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5hevc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_143"}

In this study, we explored the public conceptualization of creativity on Twitter by analyzing co-listed hashtags associated with the term #creativity in millions of tweets. Exploratory Graph Analysis was used to identify a network of semantic clusters, and a pre-trained language model yielded the sentiment of the underlying tweets. In addition, we compared the creativity-network to the network of the related concept of #innovation. The semantic clusters of #creativity reflect, on the one hand, well-known everyday creative domains focused on visual and digital arts, storytelling, and handicraft, suggesting an arts bias in the representation of creativity online. On the other hand, other semantic clusters paid tribute to the role of mindsets, teams, and imagination, feature business and innovation, and stress the importance of creativity for mental health.

The current study tested whether social feedback stimuli improve reward learning in a probabilistic reward task (PRT), in which one response option is usually rewarded more often than the other via presentation of non-social reward stimuli. \nIn a pre-registered online study, 75 participants were presented with a non-social feedback stimulus (a star) and information about gains, which is typically used in published PRT studies. Three other groups (with 73-82 participants each) were presented with one of three social feedback stimuli: verbal praise, an attractive happy face, or a \u201cthumbs up\u201d-picture The data were analysed based on classical signal-detection-theory, drift diffusion modelling, and Bayesian analyses of null effects.\nAll PRT variants yielded the expected behavioural preference for the more frequently rewarded response. There was no processing advantage of social over non-social feedback stimuli. Bayesian analyses further supported the observation that social feedback stimuli neither increased nor decreased behavioural preferences in the PRT.\nThe current findings suggest that the PRT is a robust experimental paradigm independent of the applied feedback stimuli. They also suggest that the occurrence of a processing advantage for social feedback stimuli is dependent on the experimental task and design.","tags":["social stimuli","drift diffusion modelling","probabilistic reward task","online experiment"],"date":"2023-01-11T13:05:20.397808","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zm6gj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zm6gj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zm6gj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zm6gj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_145"}
{"osf_id":"tjzyp","title":"A predictive nose: Olfactory identification is more reliant than visual identification on predictive object cues","description":"Identifying objects in the environment is one of the most important features of our senses. Toward this goal, predictions are made from known environmental regularities. It is unknown whether different sensory systems may rely differently on cues for prediction and evaluation. Olfaction, the sense of smell, provides a means to test this hypothesis. People are often unable to identify odor stimuli based on scent alone, and cues from vision and audition are often needed. We tested whether olfactory (relative to visual) identification is especially dependent on source-based predictive cues. Participants listened to word cues (object-based, e.g. \u201clilac\u201d, and category-based, e.g. \u201cflower\u201d), and then quickly determined whether a visual or olfactory target stimulus matched or did not match the word cue. As predicted, we found that the greatest response time differences between matching and non-matching trials occurred when the word cue was object-based and the target was olfactory. This interaction effect disappeared when participants were cued with category-based words (\u201cfruit\u201d or \u201cflower\u201d). A follow-up fMRI experiment revealed an increased involvement of the auditory cortex in anticipation of olfactory relative to visual objects. Furthermore, olfactory error signals activated a transmodal cortical network involving primary olfactory and visual cortices, as well as the anterior cingulate cortex. Our results suggest that olfactory identification may be especially reliant on predictive object cues and involve a vast, sensory-specific cortical error detection system. These results provide new insights into the organisation of sensory-cognitive hierarchies in the human brain.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-11T13:27:36.226016","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tjzyp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tjzyp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tjzyp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tjzyp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_146"}

Here we present a formal model of working memory, the Interference Model, that explains benchmark findings from both traditions: The shape of the error distribution from continuous reproduction of visual features, and how it is affected by memory set size; the effects of serial position for sequentially presented items, the effect of output position, and the intrusion of non-targets as a function of their distance from the target in space and in time. We apply the model to two experiments combining features of popular paradigms from both traditions: Lists of colors (Experiment 1) or of nonwords (Experiment 2) are presented sequentially and tested through selection of the target from a set of candidates, ordered by their similarity. The core assumptions of the Interference Model are: Contents are encoded into working memory through temporary bindings to contexts that serve as retrieval cues to access the contents. Bindings have limited precision on the context and the content dimension. A subset of the memory set \u2013 usually one item and its context \u2013 is maintained in a focus of attention with high precision.

In this research, we investigate how deploying algorithms in management tasks affects prosocial motivation, a crucial dimension of workplace productivity and social interactions.

We demonstrate that this negative effect (i) occurs because management by algorithms leads to greater objectification of others, (ii) also occurs when algorithms perform tasks together with human managers, and (iii) depends on the type of management task algorithms perform.

Evidence for it can be\nseen in eye behavior, with several ocular parameters being indicative of internal versus\nexternal attention focus.

However, it remains unclear whether this effect\nextends to reflexive eye behavior, which may not share cognitive resources with internal\nactivities. Therefore, the present study examined whether internal attention affects the\npupillary light response (PLR). We induced PLR by a sudden increase in luminance during\nthe performance of an internal task, which varied in modality (arithmetic vs. visuospatial) and\nworkload. We found that the PLR was not affected (e.g., attenuated) by internal attention\nacross internal tasks, and workload-related increases in pupil diameter even appeared\ndiminished during the PLR.

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic further impacted the working environments of HE staff during an already strained sociopolitical context. Drawing on needs theory, we examine the contributions of policymakers to the prevalence of mental health inequalities within HE. HE staff (n = 1,116) across the UK completed a pre-registered survey during a \u2018stay at home\u2019 order. Lower subjective SES was associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing, and with lower levels of inclusion (i.e., liking) and perceived worth (i.e., respect) by policymakers. A structural equation model revealed that inclusion and perceived worth by policymakers mediated the relationship between subjective SES and mental health and wellbeing. Perceived control by policymakers was linked to differences in mental health and wellbeing, but unexpectedly there was no evidence of a relationship with subjective SES. The findings suggest that perceptions of policymakers may exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities in mental health and wellbeing in HE. The work points to psychological needs as a novel route through which sociopolitical context may impact population mental health and wellbeing.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-11T18:01:13.987022","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Mental Health"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/usv3c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/usv3c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/usv3c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/usv3c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_153"}

Associative recognition is slower and less accurate than item recognition, suggesting that item and associative information may be represented in different forms and retrieved using different processes. Instead, I show how a dynamic model (Cox &amp; Criss, 2020; Cox &amp; Shiffrin, 2017) accounts for accuracy and response time distributions in both item and associative recognition with the same set of representations and processes. Item and associative information are both represented as vectors of features. Item and associative recognition both depend on comparing traces in memory with probes of memory in which item and associative features gradually accumulate. Associative features are slower to accumulate, but largely because they emerge from conjunctions of already-accumulated item features. I apply the model to data from 453 participants who each performed item and associative recognition following identical study conditions (Cox et al., 2018). Comparisons among restricted versions of the model show that its account of associative feature formation, coupled with limits on the rate at which features accumulate from multiple items, explains how and why the dynamics of associative recognition differ from those of item recognition even while both tasks rely on the same underlying representations.","tags":["memory models","recognition memory","response time","evidence accumulation","associative recognition"],"date":"2023-01-11T18:58:52.017899","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zdcx3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zdcx3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zdcx3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zdcx3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_154"}
{"osf_id":"j5q9h","title":"Advancing naturalistic affective science with deep learning","description":"People express their own emotions and perceive others\u2019 emotions via a variety of channels, including facial movements, body gestures, vocal prosody, and language. Studying these channels of affective behavior offers insight into both the experience and perception of emotion. Prior research has predominantly focused on studying individual channels of affective behavior in isolation using tightly controlled, non-naturalistic experiments. This approach limits our understanding of emotion in more naturalistic contexts where different channels of information tend to interact. Traditional methods struggle to address this limitation: manually annotating behavior is time-consuming, making it infeasible to do at large scale; manually selecting and manipulating stimuli based on hypotheses may neglect unanticipated features, potentially generating biased conclusions; and common linear modeling approaches cannot fully capture the complex, nonlinear, and interactive nature of real-life affective processes. In this methodology review, we describe how deep learning can be applied to address these challenges to advance a more naturalistic affective science. First, we describe current practices in affective research and explain why existing methods face challenges in revealing a more naturalistic understanding of emotion. Second, we introduce deep learning approaches and explain how they can be applied to tackle three main challenges: quantifying naturalistic behaviors, selecting and manipulating naturalistic stimuli, and modeling naturalistic affective processes. Finally, we describe the limitations of these deep learning methods, and how these limitations might be avoided or mitigated. By detailing the promise and the peril of deep learning, this review aims to pave the way for a more naturalistic affective science.","tags":["Affective Science","Generalizability","Deep Learning","Causal Manipulation","Cognitive Modeling","Naturalistic Design","Emotion"],"date":"2023-01-11T19:17:52.584093","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j5q9h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j5q9h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j5q9h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j5q9h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_155"}

{"osf_id":"m8fhk","title":"\u25cf\tRepeat after me?  Both Children with and without Autism Commonly Align Their Language with That of Their Caregivers","description":"Introduction: The role of linguistic repetition in child language is complicated. Echolalia, the persistent repetition of one\u2019s interlocutor\u2019s utterances, has long been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The literature on echolalia suggests that children with ASD often re-use fragments of language without any communicative or language-learning purpose. At the same time, research on linguistic repetition in typically developing (TD) children and adults increasingly demonstrates that linguistic repetition is an important social activity that helps create shared engagement, common ground and even scaffolds language acquisition. Depending on which literature is consulted, children with ASD, who often have social challenges, might be expected to repeat more or less than typically developing children. \nObjective: We take a systematic and nuanced approach to linguistic repetition in children with and without ASD: we distinguished exact repetition, rate, and level, as well as lexical, syntactic, and semantic repetition in a large, quasi-naturalistic corpus. We hypothesize that more rigid forms of repetition would be more frequent in ASD and would be negatively related to individual differences in linguistic, cognitive, and social skills. We hypothesize that more potentially productive forms of repetitions (alignment rate, semantic alignment) would be less frequent in ASD and would be positively related to the same individual differences.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children diagnosed with ASD and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment respectively 32.76 and 20.27 months). Alignment was calculated using the ALIGN Python library (Duran et al., 2019). We first contrasted child alignment in actual conversations with that in surrogate pairs formed by a parent and a child from two different dyads. We used Bayesian multilevel zero-and-one-inflated beta regression models. This accounts for the propensity of children to align at all (rate), the proportion of the caregiver\u2019s utterance repeated when the children do align (level), and exact repetitions, as a function of diagnostic group and developmental time. Lexical repetitions were regressed out from syntactic and semantic repetitions to minimize confounds. Analyses of individual differences include Mullen Expressive Language and Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) as proxies for linguistic skills, Visual Reception for non-linguistic cognitive skill, and Vineland Socialization for socialization skills. \nResults: We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with ASD and decreased in the TD group (at final visit, 1.2% in ASD vs. 0.7% in TD). Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers\u2019 words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit). Partial repetitions of words increased in frequency (but not level) over time, and did so faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for ASD and 40% for TD); the same happened for partial repetition of syntax (from approximately 20% of utterances in both groups at first visit to 23% for ASD and 43% for TD at last visit) and semantic alignment (from 0.34 at first visit to 0.37 for ASD and 0.44 for TD at last visit). However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Further, children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers\u2019 language (alignment rates and semantic alignment).\nDiscussion: Children with and without ASD commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers. Furthermore, most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. Interestingly, children with ASD developed this skill at a slower rate than TD children, contrary to previous findings using less fine-grained methods.

The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia.

{"osf_id":"2gq3y","title":"Diversity in autistic play: Autistic adults\u2019 experiences","description":"Background\nPlay is important for mental health and wellbeing. Descriptions of autistic play have typically focused on \u2018deficits\u2019 and are based on comparisons to neurotypical \u2018norms\u2019. According to the neurodiversity paradigm, it is important that autistic voices are highlighted, and that difficulties, differences and strengths are explored. With this in mind, we designed the present study to focus on the experiences and perspectives of autistic people concerning the topic of autistic play.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a consultation with autistic stakeholders, as well as with parents and teachers of autistic individuals to help us design the study and interview questions. We used semi-structured interviews with 22 autistic adults aged 18-57 (clinically confirmed diagnosis, n = 21; self-diagnosed, n = 1) who live in the UK. We analysed the data using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. \n\nResults \nWe found important commonalities and differences in the ways that socialisation in play, imaginary play and flow (a state involving intense focus on the play) are experienced. Autistic adults discussed the importance of both solitary and social play, with solitary play having an important recuperative function. They also reported preferences for parallel play and playing with similar autistic people. They also discussed imaginary play experiences including social role play and grounded-in-reality play, and the dual nature of flow experiences during play.\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study contrast with deficit-focused understandings of autistic play and build on neurodiversity-informed studies. We highlight, for example, the importance of considering the different circumstances under which solitary or social play are preferred, as well as the importance of taking an individual approach to play. We encourage wider understanding and acceptance of these play preferences and experiences, to support autistic people\u2019s wellbeing.","tags":["Autistic perspectives","Neurodiversity","Lived experience","Qualitative research","Interpretative phenomenological analysis","Play","Autism"],"date":"2023-01-12T09:23:40.511780","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2gq3y\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2gq3y\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2gq3y","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2gq3y","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_161"}

Results showed that children\u2019s Chinese phoneme awareness directly contributed to English pseudoword reading and predicted English word reading entirely through pseudoword reading. While the influence of Chinese onset-rime awareness on English reading is mediated exclusively through Chinese phoneme awareness. In addition, on the one hand, the bidirectional relationship between phonetic decoding and reading was found in the longitudinal English learning process. On the other hand, concurrent Chinese phoneme awareness could indirectly predict subsequent English pseudoword reading through concurrent pseudoword reading. Findings underscore the significant role of the cross-language transfer of Chinese PA in English reading and provided evidence that the coarse-grained representational unit of PA acts on reading through the fine-grained unit. Our findings also shed light on the evidence that native language proficiency directly affects second language acquisition and performance.","tags":["Chinese phonological awareness","English word reading","cross-language transfer","English phonemic decoding"],"date":"2023-01-12T11:21:55.290711","doi":null,"subjects":["Learning Process","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n46gc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/n46gc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/n46gc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n46gc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_162"}

This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a five-item version of the Reflective Function Questionnaire for Youth (RFQY-5) in a sample of adolescents with restrictive eating disorders recruited for a prospective observational study. Method: Adolescents completed the 46-item version of the RFQY at the start of treatment (T1) (n= 171) and nine months later (n=51). The factor structure, internal reliability and convergent validity of the RFQY-5 were assessed for T1. Sensitivity to change was assessed in a subsample of n=51 who completed the RFQY nine months after the start of treatment (T2). Results: At T1, the RFQY-5 demonstrated inadequate internal reliability (McDonald\u2019s Omega = .655) and poor model fit for the unidimensional structure (\u03a72(5) = 27.64; p &lt; .001; CFI = .815; TLI = .630; RMSEA = .162; SRMR = .07).

All participants completed weekly self-report measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms (Overall Anxiety Severity and Interference Scale; Overall Depression Severity and Interference Scale) and distress aversion (Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire) for the full treatment window (i.e., 12 weeks). We used structural equation modeling to test (1) if distress aversion demonstrated significant variability during the first-stage randomization and (2) if distress aversion during the first-stage randomization predicted second-stage changes in anxiety and depression. Results: Participants demonstrated significant variability in first-stage distress aversion. Latent distress aversion slopes significantly predicted latent second-stage anxiety slopes, whereas latent distress aversion intercepts significantly predicted latent second-stage depression slopes.

We included 8,893 older adults (mean age=63.18) from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of individuals over the age of 50 in the US. Comparing four domains of leisure engagement (physical, creative, cognitive, and community activities), physical activity was most consistently associated with experiences of aging. It was related to more positive aging experiences concurrently in all seven domains (daily functioning, physical fitness, long-term physical health problems, heart health, weight, sleep, subjective perceptions of health) and was beneficially associated with all but one (heart health) of these domains eight years later. Engagement in creative activities was also positively related to experiences of aging in most domains concurrently, and daily functioning, physical fitness, sleep, and subjective perceptions of health longitudinally. However, cognitive and community activity engagement were less consistently related to aging experiences, particularly longitudinally. Looking across health domains, daily functioning, physical fitness, and subjective perceptions of health were most often associated with leisure engagement. Associations were independent of other domains of leisure engagement, demographic and socioeconomic factors, and previous experiences of aging.

In Western culture, deductive reasoning first emerged as a dedicated mode of thinking in the field of geometry, but the cognitive mechanisms behind this major intellectual achievement remain largely understudied. Here, we report an unexpected cognitive bias in geometric reasoning that challenges existing theories of human deductive reasoning. Over two experiments involving almost 250 participants, we show that educated adults systematically mistook as valid a set of elementary invalid inferences with points and circles in the Euclidean plane. Our results suggest that people got \u201clocked\u201d on unwarranted conclusions because they tended to represent geometric premisses in specific ways and they mainly relied on translating, but not scaling, the circles when searching for possible conclusions. We conducted two further experiments to test these hypotheses and found confirmation for them. Although mathematical reasoning is considered as the hallmark of rational thinking, our findings indicate that it is not exempt from cognitive biases and is subject to fundamental counter-intuitions. Our empirical investigations of the source of this bias provide some insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying geometric deduction, and thus shed light on the cognitive roots of intuitive mathematical reasoning.","tags":["Deductive reasoning","Spatial cognition","Mathematical counter-intuitions","Cognitive biases"],"date":"2023-01-12T16:54:43.678821","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wbnzs\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wbnzs\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wbnzs","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wbnzs","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_168"}

The current nationwide (Sweden) infant twin study assessed participants remotely via their caregiver\u2019s tablets (N = 104, ages 3- to 17-months). To anchor our findings in previous research, we used a gaze following task where experimental and age effects have been well-established. Closely mimicking results from conventional eye tracking, we found that seeing a full head movement elicited more gaze following than seeing isolated eye movements. Further, as expected, we found that older infants followed gaze more frequently than younger infants. Finally, while we found no indication of genetic contributions to gaze following accuracy, latency to disengage from gaze cue and orient towards a target was significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins, indicative of heritability. Together, these results highlight the potential of remote assessment of infants\u2019 psychological development, which can improve generalizability, inclusion and scalability in developmental research.","tags":["development","eye tracking","remote assessment","infant cognition"],"date":"2023-01-12T17:46:44.579413","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Infancy","Perceptual Development","Cognitive Development","Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":null,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9h6ak\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9h6ak\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9h6ak","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9h6ak","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_171"}

Physicians, experts, and patients anticipate further treatment advances in the coming years.\nMethods: In October 2021, CF experts in the US and Canada were asked to provide forecasts about 8 milestones in cystic fibrosis research in an online survey (Canadian experts provided forecasts about two additional milestones about healthcare system outcomes).  CF experts were identified using lists of CF clinics available from major CF advocacy groups in the US and Canada.  We randomized experts into two different experimental arms, comparing two different forecast elicitation approaches. \nResults: 81 experts completed the survey.  Forecasts were not particularly optimistic about near term breakthroughs, though many events, including approval of anti-inflammatory drugs and approval of an amplifier drug were viewed as having at least a 40% chance of happening in the next 6 years.  Experts were still less sanguine about other events, including FDA approval of effective antibiotics for B. Cepacia, FDA approval of a therapy for those with stop mutations on both alleles and a Phase II trial testing a gene therapy (25%, 27%, and 27% probability of not occurring at all within the next 10 years). Overall, both elicitation methods produced very similar forecasts.  \nConclusions: Experts regard important advances like genetic therapy as unlikely to occur within the decade.  However, experts are very optimistic about healthcare system access to new treatments, at least in Canada.","tags":["Forecasting","Cystic Fibrosis","Prediction"],"date":"2023-01-13T03:48:47.536296","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wmycd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wmycd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wmycd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wmycd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_176"}

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the campaign. The campaign focused on the illustration of cognitive function-related symptoms and was called the \u201cFatigue of Brain\u201d campaign.\nMethods: This study retrospectively compared the duration until psychiatric consultation at health care centers in a Japanese university between data obtained from our previous study (2016-2018) with data from our newly developed mental health campaign (2018-2020). The campaign program included a small leaflet, given to all students during their physical examinations, which directed them to a special website.\nResults: The results of logistic regression analysis using data that met the eligibility and inclusion\/exclusion criteria showed that the proportion of students (40.3%) who visited psychiatric consultations within two weeks of the campaign\u2019s onset was significantly higher than the proportion of students visiting before the campaign (37.6%; OR = .578, 95% CI = .343 - .972, p = .039). Multivariate analysis revealed that the proportion of students with depressive symptoms (31.6%) was significantly higher during the campaign than before the campaign (17.3%; OR = .444, 95%CI = .234\u2013.843, p = .013).\nConclusions: The results suggest that our cognitive function-focused mental health campaign promotes earlier psychiatric consultation.","tags":["Mental health","Stigma","University student","Psychiatry","Help-seeking behavior"],"date":"2023-01-13T05:37:50.519134","doi":null,"subjects":["Health Psychology","Mental Health","Prevention","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tv954\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tv954\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tv954","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tv954","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_178"}

{"osf_id":"tkrfj","title":"Comprehensive Computational Simulation Framework for Atypical Development using Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network Model","description":"Investigating the pathological mechanisms of developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder is a challenge, because of the fact that the presented symptoms are a result of complex and dynamic factors such as genes, molecules, neural networks, cognitive behavior, environment, and developmental learning. In recent years, computational methods, including the Bayesian brain hypothesis, have been expected to provide a unified framework for understanding developmental disorders that explain the neurocognitive functions by describing the interactions between these factors. However, this approach is still limited because most studies have focused on cross-sectional task performance and lacked the perspectives of developmental learning (i.e., acquisitions of knowledge reflecting probabilistic and hierarchical structures in the environment). In this study, we proposed a new research method for understanding the mechanisms of the acquisition and its failures in hierarchical Bayesian representations using a state-of-the-art computational model, referred to as ``in silico neurodevelopment framework for atypical representation learning.'' Using the proposed framework, simple simulation experiments were conducted to examine whether manipulating the neural stochasticity and noise levels in external environments can lead to the abnormal acquisition of hierarchical Bayesian representation and reduced flexibility. Consequently, networks with normal neural stochasticity were able to acquire hierarchical representations that reflected the underlying probabilistic structures in the environment, including higher-order representation, and exhibited good flexibility. When the neural stochasticity was high, top-down generation using higher-order representation was impaired, although the flexibility did not differ from that of the normal settings. On the other hand, the networks with extremely low neural stochasticity demonstrated reduced flexibility and abnormal hierarchical representation. However, this altered acquisition of higher-order representation and flexibility was ameliorated by increasing the level of noises in external stimuli. These results demonstrated that our proposed method is useful for investigating developmental disorders with bridging multiple factors including the inherent characteristics of the neural dynamics, acquisitions of hierarchical representation, and external environment.","tags":["Computational psychiatry","Flexibility","Autism spectrum disorder","Representation learning","Active inference","Predictive coding","Neural noise"],"date":"2023-01-13T10:12:50.302313","doi":null,"subjects":["Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Learning","Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Cognitive Psychology","Systems Neuroscience","Psychiatry","Developmental Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tkrfj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tkrfj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tkrfj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tkrfj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_180"}
{"osf_id":"36yas","title":"The Neglected Importance of Auxiliary Assumptions when Applying Probability Theory","description":"Although probability theory defines how probability measures are expressed and used, it is agnostic to where these measures comes from. To apply probability theory, one must therefore make a number of auxiliary assumptions regarding assignment and interpretation of probability. In this paper I demonstrate that these assumptions can lead to radically different conclusions that are nevertheless mathematically and philosophically coherent. I further argue that behavioral science, as a rule, does not take these assumptions into consideration, but rather conflate the conceptual interpretation of probability with its mathematical application. This creates the implicit assumption that there is one, and only one, way of correctly applying probability theory to any given situation, when in reality probability theory can usually be applied in a number of different ways, all equally correct from both a mathematical and a philosophical perspective. In order for behavioral science to progress, these auxiliary assumptions must be taken into consideration, as well as be the subject of research in their own right.","tags":["probability","probability theory","research methods","assumptions"],"date":"2023-01-13T11:44:18.662417","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/36yas\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/36yas\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/36yas","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/36yas","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_181"}
{"osf_id":"qup53","title":"The effects of temperature on prosocial and antisocial behaviour: A review and meta- analysis","description":"Research from the social sciences suggests an association between higher temperatures and increases in antisocial behaviours, including aggressive, violent, or sabotaging behaviours, and represents a heat-facilitates-aggression perspective. More recently, studies have shown that higher temperature experiences may also be linked to increases in prosocial behaviours, such as altruistic, sharing, or cooperative behaviours, representing a warmth-primes-prosociality view. However, across both literatures, there have been inconsistent findings and failures to replicate key theoretical predictions, leaving the status of temperature-behaviour links unclear. Here we review the literature and conduct meta-analyses of available empirical studies that have either prosocial (e.g., monetary reward, gift giving, helping behaviour) or antisocial (self-rewarding, retaliation, sabotaging behaviour) behavioural outcome variables, with temperature as an independent variable. In an omnibus multivariate analysis (total N = 4577) with 80 effect sizes, we found that there was no reliable effect of temperature on the behavioural outcomes measured. Further, we find little support for either the warmth-primes-prosociality view or the heat- facilitates-aggression view. There were no reliable effects if we consider separately the type of behavioural outcome (prosocial or antisocial), different types of temperature experience (haptic or ambient), or potential interactions with the experimental social context (positive, neutral or negative). We discuss how these findings affect the status of existing theoretical perspectives, and provide specific suggestions advancing research in this area.","tags":["antisocial","altruism","aggression","prosocial","behaviour","priming","temperature"],"date":"2023-01-13T12:01:39.064777","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Psychology, other","Violence and Aggression","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Prosocial Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qup53\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qup53\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qup53","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qup53","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_182"}

To address this, we integrate social identity and felt understanding approaches to wellbeing and mental health, testing whether felt understanding (the belief that others understand oneself) is an important process through which social identity predicts better wellbeing, over and above other, more established mediators (social support, life meaning, and personal control). International university students (including both undergraduates and postgraduates, N = 301) completed an online survey which measured three sets of variables: social identity variables (ingroup identification, multiple identities, multiple identity compatibility); process variables (social support, felt understanding, life meaning, personal control); and wellbeing outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress). Path analyses confirmed that felt understanding predicted better wellbeing outcomes over and above the other mediators. Additionally, indirect effects from social identity variables to wellbeing via felt understanding were consistently significant, even when adjusting for the other mediators. The results are consistent with the idea that felt understanding is an under-acknowledged resource through which social identities protect wellbeing. The findings contribute to \u2018social cure\u2019 research and have implications for promoting wellbeing services from the perspective of group memberships.","tags":["social identity","wellbeing","international students","Felt understanding"],"date":"2023-01-13T13:01:28.400652","doi":null,"subjects":["Self and Social Identity","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7v39p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7v39p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7v39p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7v39p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_183"}

However, clinicians may hesitate to deliver this evidence-based intervention. By conducting a systematic review of the growing number of qualitative studies examining stakeholder perspectives on LMSC, we identified stakeholder-recommended strategies for clinicians, health system leaders, and researchers to increase LMSC acceptability. We conducted a pre-registered, comprehensive search for studies up to February 2021 using PubMed and PsycInfo. Thematic synthesis, with an inductive and iterative approach, was used to analyze findings. Eighteen studies examined the perspectives of a various stakeholders across multiple clinical settings on LMSC for firearms. Using relevant themes, we describe strategies and present scripts, rationales, and resources that may increase LMSC acceptability. Clinicians may approach LMSC in a nonjudgmental manner with awareness of their own biases, demonstrate cultural competency by acknowledging the role of firearms in patient\u2019s lives, and adapt LMSC to patients\u2019 previous experiences with firearms, safety, and injury. Clinicians can contextualize and provide a rationale for LMSC, decide whether or not to ask about access to firearms, and recommend a range of storage options tailored to the patient. Free locking devices or coupons for purchasing devices may be distributed. These strategies for potentially increasing the acceptability of LMSC for firearms are the first to be based on a comprehensive set of studies generated by diverse stakeholders.

The violation of a prediction can result in a prediction error (PE) which affects subsequent memory processing. In our preregistered studies, we examined the effects of different levels of PE on episodic memory. Participants were asked to generate predictions about the associations between sequentially presented cue-target pairs, which were violated later with individual items in three PE levels, namely low, medium, and high PE. Hereafter, participants were asked to provide old\/new judgments on the items with confidence ratings, and to retrieve the paired cues. Our results indicated a better recognition memory for low PE than medium and high PE levels, suggesting a memory congruency effect. On the other hand, there was no evidence of memory benefit for high PE level. Together, these novel and coherent findings strongly suggest that high PE does not guarantee better memory.","tags":["prediction error","episodic memory","predictive processing"],"date":"2023-01-13T14:44:18.753409","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zm29a\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zm29a\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zm29a","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zm29a","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_186"}

A systematic review was used to gather all published studies employing the IRAP and extract their designs and sample sizes. The use of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing was found to be nearly ubiquitous, justifying the examination of statistical power. Using an established method, median sample sizes were used to estimate the statistical power to detect the average published effect size in psychological research (r = .20) in each year. Sample sizes and the statistical power they imply were found to be very low in IRAP studies (in 2022: median N = 64, power = 0.34). At the current rate of growth, the median study will only reach the recommended minimum power of at least 0.80 by 2080. The IRAP literature was directly compared with the Social and Personality psychology literature using an existing dataset. Median sample sizes and their implied statistical power were lower in the IRAP literature in all years than they were in Social and Personality psychology at the beginning of the Replication Crisis in 2011, and indeed in all subsequent years.

This study investigates the association between block construction and mathematics in children who are approaching the age of formal education in the UK (4 years). It also investigates whether the relation between block construction and mathematics differs between children from more compared to less affluent families. Participants included 116 children (M = 3 years 11 months, SD = 3 months). All participants completed numeracy, block construction, and receptive vocabulary tasks. Socio-economic status and demographic information (child age, gender, ethnicity) were also obtained from parents. Regression analysis showed block construction accuracy explained 5.3% of the variation in numeracy after controlling for covariates. When separated by SES group, for children from less affluent families, block construction explained 14.9% of the variation in numeracy after covariates. For children from more affluent families, block construction explained no additional variation in numeracy. These findings highlight one possible intervention target for promoting maths-readiness in children of this age.

Yet, the very operationalization of this construct has prompted debate in the literature. Three different models have regularly been discussed: a correlated two-factor solution, a bifactorial solution, and a single-factor structure. A growing body of evidence suggests that the bifactorial model represents the adequate factorial solution; however, its validity has never been tested in a large French-speaking sample. Moreover, uncertainty remains regarding the associations between IUS-R and other psychological constructs, especially stress and depression. This project was designed to overcome these limitations. To do so, we translated the scale into French and tested (n = 728) via confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) whether the French version would better fit with a bifactorial-, correlated, or single-factor structure, as implied by previous works. We also examined the internal reliability of the IUS-R, as well as its associations with concurrent measures of stress, depression, anxiety, and worry. The results pointed to a bifactorial structure as the best-fitting model and provided evidence for a strong general intolerance of uncertainty factor that was more reliable and accounted for significantly more common variance than each subscale factor individually. We discuss how this bifactorial structure impacts the conceptualization of IU.","tags":["anxiety disorders","emotional disorders","uncertainty","psychometrics","psychopathology","intolerance to uncertainty"],"date":"2023-01-13T22:25:24.438419","doi":"10.36131\/cnfioritieditore20230106","subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Diagnosis","Psychometrics","Assessment","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cdz8g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cdz8g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cdz8g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cdz8g","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.36131\/cnfioritieditore20230106","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_191"}

Natural language Generation (NLG) is a field of computer science that focuses on generating human-like language for various applications. The theory that psychosis is related to the evolution of language in humans suggests that NLG systems that are sufficiently evolved to generate human-like language may also exhibit psychosis-like features.  In this conceptual review, we propose using NLG systems that are at various stages of development as in-silico tools to study linguistic features of psychosis.

However, no studies have explored detailed subjective accounts behind the food and mood relationship. This study aimed to uncover unknown factors in the human experience with food and mood. Using a phenomenological framework, this focus group study applied thematic template analysis to accounts of over 50 Australians aged between 18 and 72. Three themes were identified from the transcript of the focus groups (i) reactive and proactive relationships with food, (ii) acknowledgement of individual diversity relating to eating and mental health, and (iii) improving mood by removing food restriction and eating intuitively. The data highlights the complexity of the relationship between food and mood that extends beyond biological mechanisms which could be used to extend current epidemiological and intervention studies in the field of dietary patterns and depression.","tags":["mental health","food and mood","focus group","depression","thematic template analysis","psychological wellbeing","qualitative"],"date":"2023-01-14T03:58:13.950283","doi":"10.3390\/ijerph20021476","subjects":["Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sf7zm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/sf7zm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/sf7zm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sf7zm","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijerph20021476","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_193"}
{"osf_id":"s6fpy","title":"Teacher of Mathematics Identity as a Predictor of Teacher Wellbeing","description":"This article reports on original research investigating teacher wellbeing while teaching mathematics in relation to teacher identity. Using survey data from mathematics teachers (N = 402) participating in a teacher of mathematics support initiative, teacher wellbeing was operationally defined as the experience of wellbeing whilst teaching, allowing an applied understanding of wellbeing in relation to the activity of teaching. Teacher identity was construed from prior research by the authors (Willis et al., in: Math Educ Res J, 10.1007\/s13394-021-00391-w, 2021) and operationalised for the current study in terms of a specific teacher of mathematics identity (ToMI) construct. The main research question for this investigation was directed at how well the ToMI construct, as a wellbeing variable, was able to predict teacher wellbeing while teaching, viewed as an \u2018in situ\u2019 or \u2018active\u2019 (applied) measure of wellbeing. Identity-Based Motivation (IBM) theory was used to frame the research, as it helps explain how the degree of congruency between identity and wellbeing may influence motivation to teach. Results indicated that although several important factors relate significantly to teacher of mathematics wellbeing, the ToMI construct predicted teacher wellbeing far above the ability of all other study factors combined, suggesting that a focus on the development of a professional identity for teachers is fundamental to the support of teacher wellbeing in schools. Suggestions for investigating this focus at the school level are also provided.","tags":["Teacher wellbeing \u00b7 Teacher identity \u00b7 ToMI \u00b7 Identity-Based Motivation Theory \u00b7 Social support \u00b7 School belonging"],"date":"2023-01-14T04:26:29.208543","doi":"10.1007\/s13384-022-00553-0","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s6fpy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s6fpy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s6fpy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s6fpy","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s13384-022-00553-0","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_194"}

{"osf_id":"2crkm","title":"Nursing Assessment and Management of Nutrition in Older People with Cancer: An Integrative Review","description":"Background: There is a risk of malnutrition when older people are diagnosed with cancer, highlighting the need for nutritional assessments and appropriate management to be undertaken by healthcare professionals including nurses. The absence of a standardised assessment method and management of nutrition in older people creates a gap in clinical practice and warrants further research. Aim: The aim of this review was to explore the current nutritional assessment methods and evidencebased interventions for improving nutritional outcomes in older people with cancer. Methods: An integrative literature review was conducted using electronic databases. Papers were limited to those published in English between 2009 and 2021. Search terms included older adult, elder, geriatric, senior, cancer, nutrition, malnutrition, hospital, and inpatient across four databases: Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Scopus. Using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 303 articles were screened. A Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) (2018) was used for quality appraisal. Concept analysis explored themes across the included articles. Findings: The themes from the analysis of 10 primary research articles, which included 5,327 participants, were (i) types of nutritional assessment and (ii) management of older people with cancer. The main nutritional assessment scales used were the Mini Nutrition Assessment and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment. Conclusion: The completion of a comprehensive nutritional assessment by health professionals, including nurses, could facilitate early dietary intervention in older persons with cancer. This would enable supportive dietary advice and supplementation to improve health outcomes.","tags":["Nutritional assessment Malnutrition management Elderly Cancer nursing Nutritional risk status Literature review"],"date":"2023-01-14T04:54:06.399407","doi":"10.1016\/j.colegn.2022.06.012","subjects":["Life Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2crkm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2crkm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2crkm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2crkm","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.colegn.2022.06.012","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_197"}
{"osf_id":"n9b5s","title":"Differential Effects of Intuitive and Disordered Eating on Physical and Psychological Outcomes for Women with Young Children","description":"Objectives Pressure to lose weight can increase the risk of developing disordered eating behaviours, negative body image and depressive symptomatology. Eating intuitively may counteract these negative outcomes. This research examined the unique relationship between intuitive eating and disordered eating on body mass index (BMI), body image and depressive symptoms for women of young children. Methods A survey of women with a child aged between six and 48 months, included the Intuitive Eating Scale, Eating Attitudes Test-26, Body Shape Questionnaire and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted as an omnibus test to estimate the effect of intuitive and disordered eating on BMI, negative body image and depressive symptoms. Results Of the 419 sample (M age = 32.06), 32% were classified with disordered and 32% with intuitive eating. MANOVA and regression analysis found disordered eating positively associated with depressive symptoms, (\u03b2 = 0.303) and negative body image (\u03b2 = 0.318). Intuitive eating was associated with lower depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.183) and negative body image (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.615). Disordered eating (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.194) and intuitive eating (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.586) both contributed to lower BMI, with the association stronger for intuitive eating. Conclusion The early parenting period involves a high risk for developing disordered eating behaviours. Eating patterns are modifiable factors, illustrating the potential for positive and preventive health outcomes through adopting intuitive eating behaviours. There is an opportunity for healthcare professionals to promote physical and psychological health including for women in the early parenting period.","tags":["postpartum","depression","dieting","Intuitive eating","body image"],"date":"2023-01-14T04:59:00.567157","doi":"10.1007\/s10995-021-03251-y","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n9b5s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/n9b5s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/n9b5s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n9b5s","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10995-021-03251-y","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_198"}

An Analysis of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women\u2019s Health Data","description":"Depression is a chronic and complex condition experienced by over 300 million people worldwide. While research on the impact of nutrition on chronic physical illness is well documented, there is growing interest in the role of dietary patterns for those experiencing symptoms of depression. This study aims to examine the association of diet quality (Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies version 2) and depressive symptoms (Centre for Epidemiological Studies for Depression short form) of young Australian women over 6 years at two time points, 2003 (n 9081, Mean age = 27\u00b76) and 2009 (n 8199, Mean age = 33\u00b77) using secondary data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health. A linear mixed-effects model found a small and significant inverse association of diet quality on depressive symptoms (\u03b2 =\u22120\u00b703, 95 % CI (\u22120\u00b704, \u22120\u00b702)) after adjusting for covarying factors such as BMI, social functioning, alcohol and smoking status. These findings suggest that the continuation of a healthy dietary pattern may be protective of depressive symptoms. Caution should be applied in interpreting these findings due to the small effect sizes. More longitudinal studies are needed to assess temporal relationships between dietary quality and depression.","tags":["Dietary patterns: Depression: Depressive symptoms: Australian Longitudinal Study ofWomen\u2019s Health: Diet quality"],"date":"2023-01-14T05:17:00.178107","doi":"10.1017\/S0007114522002410","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Mental Health"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rwx8f\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rwx8f\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rwx8f","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rwx8f","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/S0007114522002410","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_199"}
{"osf_id":"bmr4z","title":"The Impact of Pesticides on Local Waterways: A Scoping Review and Method for Identifying Pesticides in Local Usage","description":"Pesticides used in agriculture are widely considered to be the most cost-effective way to reduce undesirable plants and animal pests and increase crop yields. However, these economic benefits should be evaluated against any deleterious impacts on the natural environment and human health. While a great deal of attention is paid to the impact of agricultural runoff, more studies are needed on the impacts of pesticides on local waterways. The aim of this study was to: (i) develop a methodology to determine which pesticides were being used in local agriculture in the Byron Shire, Australia, and (ii) search the literature for evidence of the impact of these chemicals on local waterways. After a comprehensive search involving multiple government databases, three herbicides with potentially high toxicity on the aquatic ecosystems and humans, which are used for the treatment of crops cultivated on the agricultural land in the Byron Shire, Australia, were selected for this review: bromoxynil, diquat and paraquat. In the systematic scoping review, two databases were searched (Scopus and Web of Science) for publications between January 2008 and April 2019. From 160 articles identified, 36 papers were selected for inclusion. The evidence of harmful effects at realistic field concentrations (concentrations that are within the recommended safety range for use in the environment) was found for all selected herbicides, but not on all organisms. In aquatic environments, diquat was found to be toxic to snails and bromoxynil to microalgae. The clearest and most consistent evidence was found for paraquat. At realistic field concentrations, paraquat: (i) severely inhibited healthy bacterial growth (E. coli), (ii) distorted tropical freshwater plankton communities, and (iii) increased fish kills (common carp) three times more than the weed (water hyacinth) that it was employed to control. Of particular concern is that paraquat has been banned from sale in the European Union and many countries around the world but remains available in Australia and is likely in use in the Byron Shire. While there are existing Australian government regulations restricting the use of paraquat in agriculture, further work is required to scope the extent of its use, the effectiveness of these regulations and the amount of paraquat entering the environment. This study provides a methodology that can be used to identify pesticides that are likely to be in local use and to identify evidence of any negative impacts on the health of local waterways.","tags":["Paraquat Bromoxynil Diquat Pesticides Waterways Agriculture"],"date":"2023-01-14T05:24:49.490307","doi":"10.1016\/j.envsci.2019.12.005","subjects":["Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bmr4z\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bmr4z\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bmr4z","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bmr4z","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.envsci.2019.12.005","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_200"}

However, the association between plant- based diets and mood disorders such as depression remains largely equivocal. This cross- sectional study of 219 adults aged 18\u201344 (M=31.22, SD=7.40) explored the associations between an estimate of overall plantbased diet quality and depression in vegans (n=165) and vegetarians (n=54). Overall plant- based diet quality was associated with depressive symptoms in vegans and vegetarians F(1, 215)=13.71, p&lt;0.001 accounting for 6% of the variation in depressive symptoms. For those without depression, higher diet quality was protective against depressive symptoms F(1, 125)=6.49, p=0.012. Conversely, for those with depression no association with diet quality was found F(1, 89)=0.01, p=0.963. These findings suggest that a high- quality plant- based diet may be protective against depressive symptoms in vegans and vegetarians. In line with emerging research between food and mental health, higher- quality dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms. Given the rapidly increasing rate of vegan and vegetarian food products within Australia, understanding the potential mechanisms of effects through which a plant- based diet may influence depressive symptoms is required.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-14T06:15:34.034726","doi":"10.1136\/bmjnph-2021-000332","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3eyks\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3eyks\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3eyks","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3eyks","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjnph-2021-000332","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_205"}

{"osf_id":"ub5tc","title":"Bayesian Analysis of Cross-sectional Networks: A Tutorial in R and JASP","description":"Network psychometrics is a new direction in psychological research that conceptualizes psychological constructs as systems of interacting variables. In network analysis, variables are represented as nodes and their interactions yield (partial) associations. Current estimation methods mostly use a frequentist approach, which does not allow for proper uncertainty quantification of the model and its parameters. Here, we outline a Bayesian approach to network analysis that offers three main benefits. In particular, applied researchers can use Bayesian methods to (1) determine structure uncertainty, (2) obtain evidence for edge inclusion and exclusion (i.e., distinguish conditional (in)dependence between variables), and (3) quantify parameter precision. The paper provides a conceptual introduction to Bayesian inference, describes how researchers can facilitate the three benefits for networks, and reviews the available R packages. In addition, we present two user-friendly software solutions: a new R package easybgm for fitting, extracting, and visualizing the Bayesian analysis of networks, and a graphical user interface implementation in JASP. The methodology is illustrated with a worked-out example of a network of personality traits and mental health.","tags":["tutorial","network psychometrics","JASP","R","Bayesian inference"],"date":"2023-01-14T08:19:52.234893","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Psychology, other","Psychometrics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ub5tc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ub5tc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ub5tc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ub5tc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_207"}
{"osf_id":"t9uyc","title":"Normative Dehumanization and the Ordinary Concept of a True Human","description":"Recently, I presented evidence that there are two broad kinds of dehumanization: descriptive dehumanization and normative dehumanization. An individual is descriptively dehumanized when they are perceived as less than fully human in the biological-species sense; whereas an individual is normatively dehumanized when they are perceived as lacking a deep-seated commitment to good moral values. Here, I develop the concept of normative dehumanization by addressing skepticism about two hypotheses that are widely held by dehumanization researchers. The first hypothesis is that dehumanization is distinct from mere dislike and other non-dehumanizing attitudes. The second hypothesis is that dehumanization is an important predictor of intergroup hostility. Across four studies, I found evidence that normative dehumanization is distinct from mere dislike, as well as perceptions of ideal humanness. I also found that it is a unique predictor of intergroup hostility. These findings suggest that research into dehumanization and intergroup hostility will benefit from recognizing the distinction between descriptive and normative dehumanization.","tags":["normative dehumanization","dual character concepts","intergroup hostility","essentialism"],"date":"2023-01-14T17:18:29.219233","doi":"10.1016\/j.cresp.2023.100155","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition","Intergroup Processes"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/t9uyc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/t9uyc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/t9uyc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/t9uyc","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cresp.2023.100155","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_208"}

These  models  harness  a  simple, decades-old  idea:  It  is  possible  to  learn  a  lot  about  word  meanings  just  from  exposure  to  language,  because  words  similar  in  meaning  are  used  in  language  in  similar ways.  The successes of these models raise the intriguing possibility that exposure to word use in language also shapes the word knowledge that children amass during development.  However, this possibility is strongly challenged by the fact that models use language input and learning mechanisms that may be unavailable to children.  Across three  studies,  we  found  that  unrealistically  complex  input  and  learning  mechanisms are unnecessary.  Instead, simple regularities of word use in children\u2019s language input that they have the capacity to learn can foster knowledge about word meanings.

Predictions about these behaviors are less clear for middle-aged and older adults. On the one hand, while prioritization of socioemotional goals among older adults might predict greater susceptibility to social conformity pressures, older adults also show enhanced self-control that could support resistance to conformity pressures. In this exploratory research study, we used mobile experience sampling surveys to naturalistically track how 157 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 80 practice self-control over spontaneous desires in daily life. Many of these desires were experienced in the presence of others enacting that desire. Results showed that middle-aged and older adults were better at controlling their desires than younger adults when desires were experienced in the presence of others enacting that desire. Consistent with the literature on improved emotion regulation with age, these results provide evidence that the ability to resist social conformity pressure is enhanced across the adult life span.","tags":["experience sampling methods","aging","motivation","self-control","social conformity"],"date":"2023-01-14T21:57:19.202323","doi":null,"subjects":["Motivational Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Psychology","Self-regulation","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Influence"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6s8vr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6s8vr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6s8vr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6s8vr","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_211"}

Even making sustainable buying choices has been associated with individuals\u2019 sense of identity in the socio-cultural sphere, especially when brands worldwide strongly promote them. This paper aims to inquire if sustainability consciousness could impact consumers\u2019 pride and, if yes, can fear of missing out (FoMO)-directed conformity consumption mediate the relationship between them or not. Three standardised scales: the Sustainability Consciousness Questionnaire, 14-item Hubristic and Authentic Pride Scale and Consumer Consumption-FoMO Questionnaire, were administered to 18 to 35-year-old Indian young adults (N=204) recruited online to identify their levels of sustainability consciousness, hubristic and authentic pride and FoMO-directed consumer conformity consumption behaviour. Thus, convenient sampling was employed to collect the data for the study. The analysis involved Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation followed by regression using SPSS software. Further, Sobel\u2019s tests were conducted to verify the mediating roles of FoMO-directed consumer conformity consumption behaviour in relationships across sustainability consciousness and pride. Statistical analyses revealed that sustainable behaviours positively related to authentic pride with no mediating effects by FoMO-directed consumption behaviour. Similarly, sustainability attitudes are inversely associated with hubristic pride, but no mediating effects results were significant. On the other hand, sustainability knowingness was negatively related to hubristic pride, and the relationship was mediated significantly by certain but not all dimensions of FoMO. The study instilled empirical evidence for adaptive and maladaptive types of pride derived from sustainable orientation and the significant role of FoMO in strengthening hubristic pride.","tags":["sustainability","consumption behavior","fear of missing out","pride","conformity"],"date":"2023-01-15T06:55:42.190449","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Consumer Decision Making","Consumer Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ynb78\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ynb78\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ynb78","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ynb78","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_214"}

It has been hypothesized, but not directly tested, that such metacognitive errors are partially caused by a lack of adequate feedback about the cognitive processes. In the present study, participants were often mistaken about whether their action was automatic or based on intentional deliberation. Uniquely, we were able to probabilistically determine this fact on a trial-by-trial basis and provide feedback to participants. Participants undergoing such feedback-based training improved their metacognitive sensitivity significantly more than control participants. We discuss possible interpretations of this improvement. Moreover, participants generally exhibited rather good meta-metacognition: awareness of their metacognitive sensitivity. We were able to quantify metacognitive sensitivity by comparing the reported and decoded cognitive processes leading to actions within the framework of \u201ctype 1\u201d fuzzy signal detection theory. Although the results do not unequivocally support the hypothesis we set out to explore, its unique methodology can pave the way for further research: We extend the study of metacognition beyond the domains of perception and memory to the domain of action and beyond using the performance-confidence relation as a measure of metacognition.","tags":["sense of agency","decision making","consciousness","metacognition","rationalization","signal detection theory","confabulation"],"date":"2023-01-15T09:02:05.047899","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Consciousness"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jvpcs\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jvpcs\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jvpcs","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jvpcs","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_215"}

Adolescents typically show steeper delay discounting performance than other age groups; a feature that is transdiagnostically related to a variety of mental health disorders. However, delay discounting performance is not a singular mental process but involves the competition between reward seeking and future orientation, which are usually operationalised as probability and time discounting tasks, respectively. Methods: To clarify the specific relations between the reward seeking and future orientation components of delay discounting and different types of mental health problems, two bi-factor models and a series of structural equation models (SEMs) were fitted to multi-informant (parent and adolescent self-report) mental health data from a large longitudinal study. Results: Results suggested support for: 1) a general mental health p-factor and a transdiagnostic relation of time discounting to this factor based on parent reports; 2) time discounting (future orientation\/time-waiting) as a protective factor for conduct and ADHD problems, but a risk factor for emotional problems; and 3) risk discounting preference (impulsive sensation seeking\/risk-taking) as a protective factor for emotional and peer problems. Conclusions: The findings highlight that time and risk aspects of delay discounting play partly distinct roles in different mental health problems and illuminate which aspects of delay discounting should be targeted for different mental health concerns.","tags":["transdiagnostic","cross-informant","Delay discounting","risk-taking","p-factor","future orientation","bi-factor model"],"date":"2023-01-15T09:26:12.747832","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Health Psychology","Mental Health","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4epk2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4epk2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4epk2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4epk2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_217"}

This issue of \u2018impression management\u2019 has received less attention than methodological issues associated with research credibility and reproducibility. \nWe argue that researchers and journals must recognise that research on sex\/gender differences in the brain is an issue with inherent popular appeal and significant social consequences. They must recognise their findings may be brought to public consciousness by non-experts and that hype, lack of clarity and\/or ambiguity in their research papers may lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. They therefore bear particular responsibility to ensure that research in this area is communicated accurately and responsibly and misleading impressions carefully avoided.  \nWe have identified five factors which may affect the impression given by the narrative associated with reports of research findings, together with examples of good and poor practice. We suggest that assessment of these five factors should be incorporated into research journals\u2019 editorial guidelines, to ensure that the quality of published articles is not just a function of sound theory and methodology, but also of accurate and responsible communication.","tags":["female\/male brain","science communication","sex\/gender;","gender stereotypes"],"date":"2023-01-15T14:01:01.212947","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6gpx8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6gpx8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6gpx8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6gpx8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_221"}

Indeed, despite experiencing the same task events and contingencies, different subjects may form distinct task representations. As experimenters, we often assume that subjects represent the task as we envision it. However, such a representation cannot be taken for granted, especially in animal experiments where we cannot deliver explicit instruction regarding the structure of the task. Here, we tested how rats represent an odor-guided choice task in which two odor cues indicated which of two responses would lead to reward, whereas a third odor indicated free choice among the two responses. A parsimonious task representation would allow animals to learn from the forced trials what is the better option to choose in the free-choice trials. However, animals may not necessarily generalize across odors in this way. We fit reinforcement-learning models that use different task representations to trial-by-trial choice behavior of individual rats performing this task, and quantified the degree to which each animal used the more parsimonious representation, generalizing across trial types. Model comparison revealed that most rats did not acquire this representation despite extensive experience.

{"osf_id":"ux5pr","title":"Humans combine value learning and hypothesis testing strategically in multi-dimensional probabilistic reward learning","description":"Realistic and complex decision tasks often allow for many possible solutions. How do we find the correct one? Introspection suggests a process of trying out solutions one after the other until success. However, such methodical serial testing may be too slow, especially in environments with noisy feedback. Alternatively, the underlying learning process may involve implicit reinforcement learning that learns about many possibilities in parallel. Here we designed a multi-dimensional probabilistic active-learning task tailored to study how people learn to solve such complex problems. Participants configured three- dimensional stimuli by selecting features for each dimension and received probabilistic reward feedback. We manipulated task complexity by changing how many feature dimensions were relevant to maximiz- ing reward, as well as whether this information was provided to the participants. To investigate how participants learn the task, we examined models of serial hypothesis testing, feature-based reinforcement learning, and combinations of the two strategies. Model comparison revealed evidence for hypothesis testing that relies on reinforcement-learning when selecting what hypothesis to test. The extent to which participants engaged in hypothesis testing depended on the instructed task complexity: people tended to serially test hypotheses when instructed that there were fewer relevant dimensions, and relied more on gradual and parallel learning of feature values when the task was more complex. This demonstrates a strategic use of task information to balance the costs and benefits of the two methods of learning.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-15T18:08:16.298680","doi":"10.1371\/journal","subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ux5pr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ux5pr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ux5pr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ux5pr","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_223"}

One fascinating phenomenon to emerge from this research is the transposed word effect: when asked to judge whether sentences are grammatical, readers often fail to notice grammatical errors caused by transposing two words. This effect could be evidence that readers recognize multiple words in parallel. Here we provide converging evidence that the transposed word effect is also consistent with serial processing because it occurs robustly when the words in each sentence are presented serially. We further investigated how the effect relates to individual differences in reading speed, to gaze fixation patterns, and to differences in difficulty across sentences. In a pretest, we first measured the natural English reading rate of 37 participants, which varied widely. In a subsequent grammaticality task, we presented grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in two modes: all words simultaneously, and with single words presented sequentially at each participant\u2019s natural rate. Unlike prior studies that used a fixed sequential presentation rate, we found that the magnitude of the transposed word effect was at least as strong in the sequential presentation mode as in the simultaneous mode, for both error rates and response times. Moreover, faster readers were more likely to miss transpositions of words presented sequentially. We argue that these data favor a model of comprehension in which skilled readers rely on prior knowledge to infer the meaning of sentences, allowing for apparent errors in spatial or temporal order, even when the individual words are recognized one at a time.","tags":["serial processing","word recognition","reading","parallel processing","transposed word effect"],"date":"2023-01-15T18:56:57.460812","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pgmw6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pgmw6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pgmw6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pgmw6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_224"}

Drawing from Complex Systems Theory (CST) and \u2018E\u2019 Cognitive Science (ECS), we claim that ASEs have the potential to act in a preventive capacity in support of good mental health, i.e. supporting dynamics that avoid so-called \u201cstruck states\u201d (which are, according to CST, thought generally to underpin forms of psychopathology). Here, we frame our discussion with what has recently been termed the \u201cmind-technology problem\u201d. We define and characterise ASE systems, present some examples, and briefly survey some existing theoretical work. After introducing the essential CST terminology, the paper goes on to apply CST to explain developmental adaptation to continuously changing (smart) environments. Understanding the ASE\u2019s navigation in terms of a dynamic geometry between attracting and repelling points (or local minima\/local maxima), allows us to develop neurotechnology that can augment clinical interventions by predicting upcoming shifts for good symptomatic outcomes, i.e. when a preventive intervention (i.e. destabilisation) should take place. We further offer clear directions for the development and design of such neurotechnology.","tags":["complex systems theory","Ambient Smart Environments","preventive mental health"],"date":"2023-01-15T23:17:05.186967","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/etsu4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/etsu4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/etsu4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/etsu4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_225"}

The hitting point on the circumference of the disk represents the decision outcome and the hitting time represents the decision time. The Girsanov change-of-measure theorem applied to the first-passage time distribution for the Euclidean distance Bessel process yields an explicit expression for the joint distribution of decision outcomes and decision times for the model. A problem with the expression for the joint distribution obtained in this way is that the change-of-measure calculation magnifies numerical noise in the series expression for the Bessel process, which can make the expression unstable at small times when the drift rate or decision criterion is large. We introduce a new method that uses an asymptotic approximation to characterize the Bessel process at short times and the series expression for the large times. The resulting expressions are stable across all parts of the parameter space likely to be of interest in experiments, which greatly simplifies the task of fitting the model to data. The new method applies to the spherical and hyperspherical generalizations of the model and to versions of it in which the drift rates are normally distributed across trials with independent or correlated components.","tags":["evidence accumulation","circular diffusion","diffusion model","continuous outcome"],"date":"2023-01-16T07:41:44.872256","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/npke3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/npke3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/npke3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/npke3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_226"}

Still, people vary interindividually and intraindividually in their social needs. Social need regulation theories state that mismatches between momentary social desire and actual social contact result in lowered affect, yet empirical knowledge about this dynamic regulation is limited. 306 participants in a gender- and age-heterogenous sample (51% women, M_age = 39.41, range 18-80 years) answered up to 20 momentary questionnaires about social interactions and affect while mobile sensing tracked their conversations, calls, and app usage over two days. Combining preregistered and exploratory analyses, we investigated how momentary affect relates to social dynamics, focusing on two states of mismatch between social desire and social contact: social deprivation (i.e., being alone but desiring contact) and social oversatiation (i.e., being in contact but desiring to be alone). We used specification curve analyses to scrutinize the operationalization of these constructs. Social oversatiation was associated with decreased positive affect (PA) and increased negative affect (NA). Social deprivation, however, was unrelated to affect. Exploratory multilevel models showed that a higher desire to be alone was consistently associated with decreased affective well-being, whereas a higher desire for social contact was related to increased affective well-being. Mobile sensing data revealed differential association patterns between affect and face-to-face versus digital communication. We discuss implications for social need regulation, related studies on voluntary solitude, and advantages of combining experience sampling and mobile sensing assessments.","tags":["mobile sensing","affect","social dynamics","experience sampling method","social contact"],"date":"2023-01-16T08:42:49.219798","doi":"10.1037\/emo0001309","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Individual Differences","Interpersonal Relationships","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jxznd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jxznd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jxznd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jxznd","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/emo0001309","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_227"}

While most previous studies of visual illusions focused on average group-level performance, less attention has been devoted to individual differences in susceptibility to illusions. Unlike in other perceptual domains, in which there are established, validated tools to measure individual differences, such tools are not yet available in the domain of visual illusions. Here, we describe the development and validation of the BTPI (Ben-Gurion University Test for Perceptual illusions), a new online battery designed to measure susceptibility to the influence of three prominent size illusions: The Ebbinghaus, the Ponzo, and the height-width illusions. The BTPI also measures perceptual resolution, reflected by the just noticeable difference (JND), to detect size differences in the context of each illusion. In Experiment 1 (N=143), we examined performance in typical self-paced tasks, whereas in Experiment 2 (N=69), we employed a fixed presentation duration paradigm. High test-retest reliability scores were found for all illusions, with little evidence for inter-correlations between different illusions. In addition, lower perceptual resolution (larger JND) was associated with a larger susceptibility to the illusory effect.

Imposter syndrome can be supposed to contribute to the high prevalence of mental health problems among PhD candidates, such as stress, burnout, depression, or intense negative emotions. In addition, emotion regulation is also considered an important factor for individuals\u2019 well being and adaptation to stressful situations. However, little is known about the strategies used by PhD candidates when coping negative emotions, especially by those experiencing imposter thoughts. An online questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 241 PhD candidates. Imposter syndrome appeared to be associated with a tendency to use more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., self-blame, catastrophizing) in the work context. A contrario, imposter thoughts were not associated with a tendency to use adaptive strategies (e.g., putting into perspective, planification). Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that a high self-focused belief among PhD candidates, namely the belief to be an imposter, is related to the overuse of emotion regulation strategies that are known to cause poor wellbeing and mental health problems. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","tags":["Imposter syndrome","PhD candidates","Emotion regulation","Neuroticism","Emotion"],"date":"2023-01-16T09:39:43.477186","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/atyb6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/atyb6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/atyb6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/atyb6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_229"}

For this, we trained a simple two-layer neural network on Tunisian and Italian nouns, i.e. the\nlanguages that Maltese emerged from. We used the trained network to classify Maltese nouns as either of Tunisian or of Italian origin. Overall, the network is capable of correctly classifying Maltese nouns as belonging to either of the original languages.

{"osf_id":"d2a9x","title":"Investigating the impact of acute stress on cross-frequency coupling and its relationship to endocrinological outcomes","description":"Acute stress constitutes a strong impact on the brain and on cognitive and affective processing. On the neural level, acute stress modifies attention, memory, and executive functions. Moreover, it is related to an increase in stress hormones and negative affect. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a suitable tool to investigate the influence of acute stress on brain activity non-invasively as it measures fluctuations in the excitability of neural populations as oscillations in the EEG signal. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between activity in the delta (1-4 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) frequency bands has been implicated as a potential neural correlate of stress regulation processes: frontal delta-beta CFC could reflect communication between subcortical structures involved in the generation of negative affect and frontal cortical structures associated with the regulation of said affect. To investigate the influence of acute stress on delta-beta CFC and its role in stress regulation, 50 participants underwent acute stress induction via social evaluative threat as well as a control procedure on separate days. EEG data were recorded during stress induction and the control procedure. We calculated amplitude-to-amplitude (AAC) correlations and phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the delta and beta band activity at frontal (F3, F4, Fz) and parietal (P3, P4, Pz) electrodes. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between mean frontal and parietal AAC during stress and control procedure revealed higher AAC during stress at parietal electrodes. Tests between mean frontal and parietal PAC during stress and control procedure revealed higher PAC during stress at frontal and parietal electrodes compared to the control condition. Spearman correlations between mean AAC, mean PAC, and markers of the physiological stress response (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) were not significant. Our results indicate that acute stress has a strong influence on cross-frequency coupling between the delta and beta bands. However, these changes were not associated with changes in physiological stress markers, calling the validity of delta-beta CFC as a marker for stress regulation into question. It is possible that changes in delta-beta CFC and endocrinological and subjective stress measures reflect distinct aspects of the stress response that do not necessarily correlate.","tags":["Stress","Cortisol","Beta-Delta Coupling","EEG","Cross-Frequency-Coupling"],"date":"2023-01-16T10:39:21.130938","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Stress","Cognitive Psychology","Health Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/d2a9x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/d2a9x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/d2a9x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/d2a9x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_231"}

Recently, evidence from eye-movements has suggested that unexpected sounds also temporarily pause the movements of the eyes during reading, though it\u2019s unclear if this effect is due to inhibition of oculomotor planning or inhibition of language processes. Here, we sought to distinguish between these two possibilities by comparing a natural reading task to a letter-scanning task that involves similar oculomotor demands to reading, but no higher-level language processing. Participants either read sentences for comprehension or scanned letter strings of these sentences for the letter \u2018o\u2019 in three auditory conditions: silence, standard, and novel sounds.

Visualizing previous intensity levels improves emotion (dynamic) measurement in experience sampling","description":"It is a long known reality that humans have difficulty to accurately rate the absolute intensity of internal experiences, yet the predominant way experience sampling (ESM) researchers assess participants\u2019 momentary emotion levels is by means of an absolute measurement scale. In a daily-life experiment (n = 178), we evaluate the efficacy of two alternative measurement methods that solicit a simpler, relative emotional evaluation: (1) the visualization of a relative anchor point on the absolute rating scale that depicts people\u2019s previous emotion rating, and (2) the phrasing of relative emotion items that ask for a comparison with earlier emotion levels by means of a relative rating scale. Using six quality criteria relevant for ESM, we conclude that the use of a visual \u2018Last\u2019 anchor significantly improves emotion measurement in daily life: (a) Theoretically, this method has the best perceived user experience, which suggests that it better aligns with people\u2019s emotional rating experience. Methodologically, this type of measurement generates ESM time series that (b) carry a stronger emotional signal, (c) exhibit less measurement error, produce person-level emotion dynamic measures that are (d) more stable, and generally show stronger (e) unique and (f) incremental relations with external criteria like neuroticism and borderline personality. In sum, we see great value in the addition of a relative \u2018Last\u2019 anchor to the absolute measurement scales of  future ESM studies on emotions, as it structures the ambiguous rating space and introduces more standardization within and between individuals. In contrast, using relatively phrased emotion items is not recommended.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-16T11:49:33.326859","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Individual Differences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/avbyc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/avbyc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/avbyc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/avbyc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_233"}

To see if an immersive version implemented with a head-mounted display (HMD) and a non-immersive version employing a flat screen display (FSD) yield similar results, we had 72 typically developing 9- to 13-year-old children to play both versions in a counterbalanced order. The children\u2019s everyday executive functions were assessed with the parent-rated Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Functions (BRIEF) questionnaire. To assess the applicability of EPELI for online testing, half of the FSD version gameplays were conducted remotely and the rest in the laboratory.\nRESULTS: All EPELI performance measures were correlated across the versions. The children\u2019s performance was mostly similar in the two versions, but small effects reflecting higher performance in FSD-EPELI were found in the measures of Total score, Task efficacy, and Time-based prospective memory score. The children engaged in more active time monitoring in FSD-EPELI. While the children evaluated the feeling of presence and the usability of both versions favorably, most children preferred HMD-EPELI, and evaluated its environment to be more involving and realistic. Both versions showed only negligible problems with the interface quality. No differences in task performance or subjective evaluations were found between the home-based and laboratory-based assessments of FSD-EPELI. In both EPELI versions, the efficacy measures were correlated with BRIEF on the first assessment, but not on the second. This raises questions about the stability of the associations reported between executive function tasks and questionnaires. \nCONCLUSIONS: Both the HMD and FSD versions of EPELI are viable tools for the naturalistic assessment of goal-directed behavior in children. While the HMD version provides a more immersive user experience and naturalistic movement tracking, the FSD version can maximize scalability, reachability, and cost efficacy, as it can be used with common hardware and remotely. Taken together, the findings highlight similarities between the HMD and FSD versions of a cognitively complex VR task, but also underline the specific advantages of these common presentation modes.","tags":["online testing","prospective memory","serious gaming","naturalistic task","executive functions","ecological validity"],"date":"2023-01-16T13:55:56.445406","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/56u9v\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/56u9v\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/56u9v","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/56u9v","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_234"}

We conducted bivariate correlations and found that better objective hearing was associated with better objective cognition, better subjective hearing was associated with better subjective cognition and better subjective mobility, and poorer subjective cognition was associated with better objective mobility. Using a series of stepwise backward linear regressions, we found that better subjective hearing predicted both better subjective cognition and better subjective mobility.

Moreover, it has been shown that the time-course of processing ironic meaning is affected by readers working memory capacity (WMC). Irony is a context-dependent phenomena but using traditional eye-movement measures it is difficult to analyze processing beyond sentence-level. A promising method to study individual differences in irony processing at the paragraph-level is scanpath analysis. In the present experiment, we analyzed whether individual differences in WMC are reflected in scanpaths during reading ironic stories by combining data from two previous eye-tracking studies (N=120). The results revealed three different reading patterns: fast-and-linear reading, and selective and non-selective rereading.

{"osf_id":"vs7p9","title":"Large-scale disruptive activism strengthened environmental attitudes in the United Kingdom","description":"The 2019 London Extinction Rebellion was the first attempt by environmental protesters to create prolonged large-scale disruption in a Western capital city. The effects on public opinion were difficult to predict because protests seen as extreme can reduce support, but protests seen as justified can increase support. We studied longitudinal opinion changes in a nationally representative sample (n = 832) before, during, and after the rebellion, in conjunction with experimental analysis of the causal effects of media reports (n = 1441). The rebellion was longitudinally associated with national increases in environmental concern, and activist media increased dissatisfaction with current government action. Reports from an activist, the BBC, and the Daily Mail caused activism intentions and support to move in different directions, contributing to longitudinally increased polarisation in attitudes to activism. The rebellion had minimal effects on belief in whether ordinary people can produce relevant change (based on collective efficacy and support for a Citizens\u2019 Assembly). The rebellion thus succeeded in some aims and did not show evidence of any important backlash.","tags":["environmental activism","public opinion","longitudinal and experimental methods","civil disobedience","Extinction Rebellion"],"date":"2023-01-16T17:27:13.947237","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vs7p9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vs7p9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vs7p9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vs7p9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_240"}

The interplay between different internalizing and externalizing mental health problems in adolescence is poorly understood at the within-person level. Executive functioning (EF) in early adolescence has been shown to constitute a transdiagnostic risk factor, but the specificity of the associations between different domains of EF and internalizing\/externalizing mental health problems remains unclear. Leveraging data from a large longitudinal panel study of adolescents (TRAILS, n &gt; 1641) assessed at ages 11, 13, and 15, we investigated the network dynamics of different internalizing and externalizing symptoms. We showcase the use of two novel methodological panel network approaches: cross-lagged panel network models (CLPN) and graphical vector autoregressive (GVAR) models. Moreover, we used hierarchical regression models to investigate prospective associations between different measures of EF (working memory, sustained attention, shifting attention) and broadband transdiagnostic dimensions (internalizing\/externalizing symptoms). Depressive symptoms emerged as an important bridge connecting clusters of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems in the cross-sectional networks. Importantly, depressive symptoms predicted a range of other internalizing symptoms (i.e., panic, somatic problems, separation anxiety, general anxiety, social phobia) over time, in particular during early adolescence. In contrast, social phobia symptoms were most strongly predicted by other symptoms. Externalizing symptoms, such as oppositional-defiant problems and inattention\/hyperactivity predicted depressive and OCD symptoms at the within-person level respectively. We identified important feedback loops with reciprocal associations between different anxiety symptoms (e.g., separation anxiety \u2013 general anxiety, and panic symptoms \u2013 somatic problems). Different facets of EF assessed at age 11, in particular sustained attention, showed weak but significant prospective associations with internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 13 and 15. Our findings speak to the importance of attending to depressive symptoms in early adolescence to prevent a spiral of different internalizing symptoms from arising later on.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-16T18:09:56.507747","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6suq4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6suq4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6suq4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6suq4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_241"}
{"osf_id":"wtpdz","title":"Transfer of Statistical Learning from Passive Speech Perception to Speech Production","description":"One\u2019s own speech can be affected when communicating with a speaker with a different accent. Despite  the  strength  of  anecdotal  evidence  for  perception-production  transfer,  the  nature  of transfer has remained elusive. Results have been highly variable both regarding the acoustic properties that transfer between speakers and the characteristics of the speakers who show transfer.  The  current  study  investigates  perception-production  transfer  through  the  lens  of dimension-based  statistical  learning.    Participants  passively  listened  to  a  short  sequence  of acoustically variable minimal pair (beer\/pier) speech segments conveying either an accent or typical English acoustics, made a perceptual judgment to an ambiguous Test stimulus and then repeated the Test stimulus. In the Canonical condition, F0 and voice onset time (VOT) of \/b\/ and \/p\/ covaried according to their usual pattern in English. In the Reverse condition, the correlation was reversed to create an \u2019accent\u2019 with speech input regularities atypical of English. Perceptual categorization showed down-weighting of F0 in the Reverse vs. the Canonical condition. Critically, this down-weighting transferred to production, with systematic changes to F0 when speakers repeated the Test stimulus in the Reverse vs. the Canonical condition. Both findings were robust in male and female participants. These results indicate that the mapping of acoustics to speech categories is rapidly adjusted by short-term input regularities experienced across passive listening and that these adjustments transfer robustly to speech production, regardless of sex.","tags":["Auditory Word Repetition","Phonetic Convergence","Statistical Learning","Speech Perception","Phonetic Cue Weighting","Dimension-based Statistical Learning","Cue Weighting","Speech Production"],"date":"2023-01-16T18:36:47.525285","doi":null,"subjects":["Linguistics","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Phonetics and Phonology","Psychology, other","Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wtpdz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wtpdz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wtpdz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wtpdz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_242"}
{"osf_id":"3v45a","title":"The Wisdom of Timely Crowds","description":"In most forecasting contexts, each target event has a resolution time point at which the \u201cground truth\u201d is revealed or determined. It is reasonable to expect that as time passes, and information relevant to the event resolution accrues, the accuracy of individual forecasts will improve. For example, we expect forecasts about stock prices on a given date to be more accurate as that date approaches, or forecasts about sport tournament winners to become more accurate as the tournament progresses. This time dependence presents several issues for extracting the wisdom of crowds, and for optimizing differential weights when members of the crowd forecast the same event at different times. In this chapter, we discuss the challenges associated with this time dependence and survey the quality of the various solutions in terms of collective accuracy. To illustrate, we use data from the Hybrid Forecasting competition, where volunteer non-professional forecasters predicted multiple geopolitical events with time horizons of several weeks or months, as well as data from the European Central Bank\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters which includes only a few select macroeconomic indices, but much longer time horizons (in some cases, several years). We address the problem of forecaster assessment, by showing how model-based methods may be used as an alternative to proper scoring rules for evaluating the accuracy of individual forecasters; how information aggregation can weigh concerns of forecast recency as well as sufficient crowd size; and explore the relationship between crowd size, forecast timing and aggregate accuracy. We also provide recommendations both for managers seeking to select the best analysts from the crowd, as well as aggregators looking to make the most of the overall crowd wisdom.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-16T19:52:53.310372","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3v45a\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3v45a\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3v45a","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3v45a","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_243"}

However, since reading is limited by visual acuity in the periphery, whether impoverished perception entails immunity to reading-based linguistic influence remains unknown. Here we leveraged a peripheral sound-induced flash illusion to directly examine whether the semantic influence of perception occurred with unrecognizable words. We successfully replicated the original illusions with Mandarin characters. Crucially, the lack of a concurrent beep suppressed the awareness of an existing character to a greater extent when the characters formed a word. A separate experiment replicated the effect on participants who were unable to recognize the words, corroborating the implicit nature of the effect. When the reading was disrupted by reversing the presentation order, the effect disappeared. These findings demonstrate the capacity of our visual system to implicitly extract peripheral linguistic information, which in turn regulates our visual awareness.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-17T08:10:14.827395","doi":null,"subjects":["Multisensory Integration","Linguistics","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Consciousness","Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/k3hdb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/k3hdb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/k3hdb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/k3hdb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_245"}

However, field testing of these techniques is limited, and their ecological validity thus remains to be investigated. In Fall 2021, a prospecting campaign for geothermal exploration deployed seismic trucks at night that created noise and seismic vibrations which could negatively affect public support for geothermal energy systems. Here, we employed a trust inoculation in a preregistered, longitudinal field study, to make the trustworthiness of the utility company salient to protect public support of geothermal energy systems against this local negative event. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that the event affected participants\u2019 public support towards renewable energy, nor that the trust inoculation influenced said support. This could have been due to the unintended negative influence of the time delay between the delivery of the trust inoculation and the negative event, as the inoculation was more effective with the longest time delay between its delivery and the negative event, but had unintended negative consequences with the shortest delay. We conclude placing these results in the growing psychological inoculations literature and providing recommendations for future field studies for psychological inoculations.","tags":["Geothermal energy","Renewable energy","Prebunking","Longitudinal study","Field study","Trust","Psychological inoculation","Inoculation theory","Public acceptance"],"date":"2023-01-17T10:05:52.605850","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Environmental Psychology","Politics","Attitudes and Persuasion","Sustainability Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Influence"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v9xgn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/v9xgn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/v9xgn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v9xgn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_246"}

{"osf_id":"5sjwz","title":"Rationally irrational: When people do not correct their reasoning errors even if they could","description":"Why is it that sometimes people do not correct their reasoning errors? The dominating dual-process theories of reasoning detail how people (fail to) detect their reasoning errors but underspecify how people decide to correct these errors once they are detected. We have unpacked the motivational aspects of the correction process here, leveraging the research on cognitive control. Specifically, we argue that when people detect an error, they decide whether or not to correct it based on the overall expected value associated with the correction\u2014combining perceived efficacy and the reward associated with the correction while considering the cost of effort. Using a modified two-response paradigm, participants solved cognitive reflection problems twice while we manipulated the factors defining the expected value associated with correction at the second stage. In five experiments (N = 5,908), we found that answer feedback and reward increased the probability of correction while cost decreased it, relative to the control groups. These cognitive control critical factors affected the decisions to correct reasoning errors (Experiments 2 and 3) and the corrective reasoning itself (Experiments 1, 4 and 5) across a range of problems, feedbacks, types of errors (reflective or intuitive), and cost and reward manipulations pre-tested and checked in five separate studies (N = 951). Thus, some people did not correct their epistemically irrational reasoning errors because they followed the instrumentally rational principle of the expected value maximisation: they were rationally irrational.","tags":["Cognitive Reflection Test","dual-process theory","incentives","error correction","expected value of control"],"date":"2023-01-17T10:53:06.284387","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Reasoning","Problem Solving","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5sjwz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5sjwz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5sjwz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5sjwz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_248"}
{"osf_id":"235vp","title":"Features of Moral Consideration for Artificial Entities: A Conjoint Experiment","description":"The moral consideration of intelligent artificial entities (e.g., robots, virtual personal assistants) is a topic of growing academic interest. Studies have identified a range of features that are associated with the moral consideration of such entities, often in the context of two accounts: mind perception and humanness (i.e., anthropomorphism and dehumanization). The present study brings together and builds on this growing body of research by evaluating the relative importance of the various features of moral consideration. We conducted an online conjoint experiment in which 1,163 participants evaluated 30,238 profiles of artificial entities that randomly varied on 11 features. All 11 features affected the extent to which participants consider it morally wrong to harm an artificial entity. The two most important features were an entity\u2019s capacity for emotion expression and moral judgment. These were followed by emotion recognition, cooperation, and the entity\u2019s body (in particular, having a human-like physical body). Overall, the results provide support for a humanness account of moral consideration: the more human-like artificial entities are perceived to be in their mental, physical, and behavioral characteristics, the more moral consideration they are given. Within the humanness account, the study supports the view that capacities that are associated with the \u201chuman nature\u201d dimension more strongly affect moral consideration than capacities associated with the \u201cuniquely human\u201d dimension, but both dimensions positively affect moral consideration.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-17T12:23:31.971419","doi":null,"subjects":["Moral Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/235vp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/235vp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/235vp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/235vp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_249"}

We found no overall effects of either taking the perspective of a farmed pig or an artificial entity on moral attitudes, compared to instructions to stay objective and a neutral condition. However, in both studies, mediation analysis indicated that perspective taking positively affected moral attitudes via empathic concern and self-other overlap, supporting two mechanisms well-established in the literature. The lack of overall effects may be partly explained by positive effects of staying objective on moral attitudes that offset the positive effects of perspective taking via empathic concern and self-other overlap. These findings suggest that perspective taking functions differently in the context of non-human groups relative to typical intergroup contexts.

However, many people experiencing such symptoms may not qualify for, or may not seek, treatment. Potentially contributing to ongoing residual symptoms of PTSS is emotion dysregulation. Meanwhile, the research area of mindfulness and compassion has grown to imply emotion regulation as one of its underlying mechanisms, yet, its efficacy on emotion regulation in PTSS cohort is unknown. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an 8-week Compassion-oriented and Mindfulness-based Exposure Therapy (CoMET) for individuals with PTSS using a waitlist control design. A total of 28 individuals (27 females, age range = 18-39 years) participated in the study (17 CoMET; 11 control). Following CoMET, participants reported significant decreases in PTSS severity (from clinical to non-clinical levels), emotion dysregulation, and experiential avoidance, as well as significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and quality of life. Enhanced emotion regulation also mediated the relationship between increases in mindfulness and self-compassion with decreases in PTSS severity, while the waitlist control showed no changes, except for significant increases in difficulties with emotion regulation. Electroencephalogram-based brain network connectivity analysis revealed an increase in alpha-band connectivity following CoMET in a network that includes the amygdala, suggesting that CoMET successfully induced changes in functional connectivity between brain regions that play a crucial role in emotion regulation. In sum, the current study demonstrated promising intervention outcomes of CoMET in effectively alleviating the symptoms of PTSS via enhanced emotion regulation.","tags":["Compassion","Clinical Intervention","Mindfulness","Emotion Regulation","Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms"],"date":"2023-01-17T12:36:20.871457","doi":null,"subjects":["Trauma and Stress","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychotherapy","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":null,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kah76\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kah76\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kah76","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kah76","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_251"}

We provide evidence that abstract geometry reflects the geometry humans and non-human animals use for spatial navigation. Across two preregistered experiments, educated adults watched short videos of two points and two line segments forming an open figure on an otherwise blank screen. These simple visuals were described with sparse and minimally different language, creating different spatial contexts. After watching each video, participants were asked to click: anywhere (anywhere condition); to complete the triangle (triangle condition); where the next corner of an object would be (object condition); where the next stop on an agent\u2019s path would be (navigation condition); or where the next point on an abstract plane would be (abstract condition). Across spatial contexts, participants produced responses that reflected strikingly different sets of geometric representations; in particular, preserving distance and direction for open paths in the navigation condition but preserving length and angle for closed shapes in the object condition. In the navigation and abstract contexts, however, the elicited geometry was remarkably similar. Human language may thus effectively isolate phylogenetically ancient geometric representations used for navigating the physical world and recognizing the objects in it. Moreover, the cognitive origins of uniquely human abstract geometry may lie in representations used for navigating the physical world.","tags":["spatial language","abstract thought","object recognition","navigation","geometry"],"date":"2023-01-17T14:40:28.461850","doi":null,"subjects":["Educational Psychology","Perception","Concepts and Categories","Cognitive Psychology","Psychology, other","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ay42r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ay42r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ay42r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ay42r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_252"}

We model data from student performance on groups of tasks that assess the same skill component and that provide follow-up instruction on student errors. Our models estimate, for both students and skills, initial correctness and learning rate, that is, the increase in correctness after each practice opportunity. We applied our models to 1.3 million observations across 27 datasets of student interactions with online practice systems in the context of elementary to college courses in math, science, and language. Despite the availability of up-front verbal instruction, like lectures and readings, students demonstrate modest initial pre-practice performance, at about 65% accuracy. Despite being in the same course, students\u2019 initial performance varies substantially from about 55% correct for those in the lower half to 75% for those in the upper half. In contrast, and much to our surprise, we found students to be astonishingly similar in estimated learning rate, typically increasing by about 0.1 log odds or 2.5% in accuracy per opportunity.

{"osf_id":"f52ud","title":"Preventing mind-wandering during driving: Predictions on potential interventions using a cognitive model","description":"In this study, we make predictions on the effects of different interventions by adaptive automation systems designed to prevent mind-wandering while driving. Although cognitive load associated with secondary tasks tends to affect driving negatively, a simple secondary task can improve driving performance when the driving scenario is mundane. Nijboer and colleagues (2016) have hypothesized that if the driving task is simple, people might start mind-wandering, which interferes with\ndriving. Furthermore, the authors proposed that a simple secondary task, which imposes less workload than mind-wandering, could prevent this from happening and thereby improve driving performance. Automation systems that are informed about and adapt to the cognitive state of the driver could leverage this effect by inducing mild cognitive load during mundane driving scenarios. To test suitable interventions, we combined an existing driver model with an existing model\nof mind-wandering implemented in the cognitive architecture ACT-R as executable theories of mind-wandering and cognitive processing in driving. Using these different models we show how mind-wandering harms driving performance at the behavioral level and that interventions eliciting mild cognitive load can mitigate this behavioral effect. However, the model indicates that some interventions incur a significant cognitive processing cost that adaptive automation systems must account for.","tags":["Cognitive Load","Human-Computer-Interaction","Adaptive Automation","Cognitive Model","Mind-wandering"],"date":"2023-01-17T15:55:05.840995","doi":null,"subjects":["Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f52ud\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/f52ud\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/f52ud","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f52ud","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_255"}
{"osf_id":"dwyqa","title":"Words for Sale: Linguistic Complexity Associates with Higher Housing Prices in Online Realty Advertisements","description":"Prior work suggests when instrumental goals are salient (e.g., when people believe that others are trying to achieve something effortful and valuable), linguistic complexity associates with positive behavioral outcomes compared to linguistic simplicity. For example, in the descriptions of charitable giving campaigns and online petitions, fewer common words, more analytic writing, and less readable writing associated with more funding and petition signatures, respectively. These patterns have rarely been replicated, requiring more investigation into the idea that fluency and linguistic complexity are context-contingent heuristics. The current work used descriptions from over 1,000 online realty advertisements to associate with housing prices. The evidence indeed replicated prior research: linguistic complexity (e.g., fewer common words, more analytic writing, and less readable writing) associated with higher housing prices. These data facilitated the explication of the contingent-on-effort hypothesis: linguistic complexity is favored to the degree that people value effort in a particular setting.","tags":["instrumental goal activation","complexity","LIWC","automated text analysis","language"],"date":"2023-01-17T16:11:13.170870","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Linguistics","Quantitative Methods","Computational Linguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dwyqa\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/dwyqa\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/dwyqa","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dwyqa","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_256"}

However, large-scale analysis of open text has traditionally had a prohibitive cost. Through natural language processing techniques, we examined over 3.5 million office discipline records from a national sample of over 4,000 schools for whether teachers\u2019 linguistic patterns differed when describing incidents depending on the race\/ethnicity and gender of the students. Results of such analyses consistently showed that teachers wrote longer descriptions and included more negative emotion when disciplining Black compared to White students, especially for Black girls. In conjunction with psychology of language theory, the patterns suggest that teachers may perceive and process student behavior differently depending on student identities. Implications of the findings and potential for research on naturally occurring language data in education are discussed.","tags":["automated text anaysis","education","education bias","bias","language"],"date":"2023-01-17T16:57:17.087382","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Linguistics","Computational Linguistics","School Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q4euh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/q4euh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/q4euh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q4euh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_257"}

A real-world example of this is research into the mental health of children and young people during the Covid-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that clinicians and services are struggling with increased demand, yet population studies looking at the difference in mental health before and during the pandemic report effect sizes that are deemed \u201csmall\u201d. In this short review we utilise simulations to demonstrate that a relatively small shift in mean scores on mental health measures can indicate a large shift in the number of cases of anxiety and depression when scaled up to an entire population.

{"osf_id":"m746a","title":"Objects of inquiry: Examining the origins of gender-based objectification","description":"Objectification\u2014the psychological phenomenon of relegating people to the status of objects\u2014is associated with a host of negative consequences, from diminished cognitive performance to heightened risk of danger. Girls and women constitute the primary targets of objectification; thus, these harms fall disproportionately on them. Despite the severity of its impacts, however, the developmental origins of such gender-based objectification have received little empirical attention, limiting our grasp of this phenomenon both theoretically and practically. In the present research, we sought to address this gap on two fronts. First, we tested whether and to what extent gender-based objectification gets applied to young targets (n = 237 adults), and second, we tested when this tendency first begins to develop in young perceivers (n = 352 children, ages 5-10 years). We found robust evidence that adults engage in gender-based objectification of young children: in both a speeded categorization task and a property attribution task, adults\u2019 concepts of girls and boys overlapped with their concepts of objects and humans, respectively. Children themselves also showed evidence of gender-based objectification, but in a more limited manner: boys, but not girls, engaged in gender-based objectification, and only at the level of their categorizations. Together, these findings suggest that gender-based objectification extends to perceptions of young children and begins to develop early in childhood\u2014indicating that the consequences of gender-based objectification may be far larger in scope, and earlier emerging, than previously assumed.","tags":["Development","Gender","Objectification"],"date":"2023-01-17T18:51:56.591470","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m746a\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/m746a\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/m746a","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m746a","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_259"}

{"osf_id":"e6krn","title":"People update their injunctive norm beliefs and moral judgements after receiving descriptive norm information","description":"What role do descriptive norms play in forming injunctive norm beliefs and what does that tell us about the cognitive processes underlying social norm cognition? Across six studies (N=2,671), we examined whether people update their injunctive norm beliefs\u2014as well as their moral judgements and behavioral intentions\u2014after receiving descriptive norm information about how common (or uncommon) a behavior is. Specifically, we manipulated the descriptive normativity of behaviors, describing behaviors\u2019 normativity as weak (20% of people were doing the behavior) or strong (80% of people were doing the behavior). To measure belief updating, we assessed beliefs prior to and after receiving information about the descriptive norm. We find that participants updated their injunctive norm beliefs, moral judgements, and behavioral intentions after receiving descriptive norm information. Specifically, participants positively updated their prior beliefs (i.e., rated behaviors more injunctively normative and moral)\u2014after receiving a strong descriptive norm and negatively updated their prior beliefs (i.e., rated behaviors less injunctive and moral) after receiving a weak descriptive norm. Across all measures, participants updated their beliefs to a greater extent for strong compared to weak descriptive norms.

{"osf_id":"upmka","title":"The inverse relation of pre-nuclear and nuclear prominences in German","description":"The importance of pre-nuclear prominences for focus marking has been largely neglected. Recent studies however present first evidence that the prosody of the pre-nuclear region indicates its status as part of a broad focus or as pre-focal. This study presents a systematic investigation of the pre-nuclear domain and its relation to the nuclear accent in German. The results show that the realization of the pre-nuclear domain indeed depends on whether it is focal or pre-focal: The pre-nuclear noun is characterized by larger F0 excursions, higher F0 maxima and longer durations when it is in broad focus than when it precedes a narrow focus. Furthermore, the realiza-tion of a pre-focal, pre-nuclear domain depends on the following focus: The pre-nuclear noun is produced with smaller F0 excursions, lower F0 maxima and shorter durations before a corrective focus than before a non-corrective narrow focus. The comparison to the nuclear accent suggests an inverse rela-tionship, i.e., the pre-nuclear domain becomes less prominent (i.e., realized with smaller F0 excursions, lower F0 maxima and shorter durations) when the nuclear domain becomes more prominent. The findings suggest that the phonetic manifestation of information structure is distributed over larger prosodic domains and entails the modulation of phrasal prominence profiles rather than just local adjustments of the nucleus.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-17T20:23:48.570621","doi":null,"subjects":["Phonetics and Phonology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/upmka\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/upmka\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/upmka","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/upmka","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_263"}

However, many people experiencing such symptoms may not qualify for, or may not seek, treatment. Potentially contributing to ongoing residual symptoms of PTSS is emotion dysregulation. Meanwhile, the research area of mindfulness and compassion has grown to imply emotion regulation as one of its underlying mechanisms, yet, its efficacy on emotion regulation in PTSS cohort is unknown. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an 8-week Compassion- oriented and Mindfulness-based Exposure Therapy (CoMET) for individuals with PTSS using a waitlist control design. A total of 28 individuals (27 females, age range = 18-39 years) participated in the study (17 CoMET; 11 control). Following CoMET, participants reported significant decreases in PTSS severity (from clinical to non-clinical levels), emotion dysregulation, and experiential avoidance, as well as significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and quality of life. Enhanced emotion regulation also mediated the relationship between increases in mindfulness and self-compassion with decreases in PTSS severity, while the waitlist control showed no changes, except for significant increases in difficulties with emotion regulation. Electroencephalogram-based brain network connectivity analysis revealed an increase in alpha-band connectivity following CoMET in a network that includes the amygdala, suggesting that CoMET successfully induced changes in functional connectivity between brain regions that play a crucial role in emotion regulation. In sum, the current study demonstrated promising intervention outcomes of CoMET in effectively alleviating the symptoms of PTSS via enhanced emotion regulation.","tags":["trauma","compassion","emotion regulation","posttraumatic stress symptoms","mindfulness","clinical intervention"],"date":"2023-01-17T23:00:43.681504","doi":null,"subjects":["Trauma and Stress","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychotherapy","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8rgp3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8rgp3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8rgp3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8rgp3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_264"}
{"osf_id":"hx8un","title":"The Exceptions and the Rules in global musical diversity","description":"Global music diversity is a popular topic for both scientific and humanities researchers, but often for different reasons. Scientific research typically focuses on the generalities through measurement and statistics, while humanists typically emphasize exceptions using qualitative approaches. But these two approaches need not be mutually exclusive. By using a quantitative approach to identify musical outliers, and a qualitative discussion of the most unusual songs, we can tie together scientific, and humanities approaches to unite knowledge on musical diversity. Objectively defining unusual music is a delicate task, having historically been subject to Eurocentric approaches. Using the Global Jukebox, a dataset containing almost 6,000 songs from over 1,000 societies coded on 37 \u201cCantometric'' variables of musical style, we designate the unusualness of a song as the frequency of its coded variables relative to their regional frequency. Using quantitative metrics to identify outliers in musical diversity, we present a qualitative discussion of some of the most unusual individual songs (from a Panpipe ensemble from Kursk, Russia), and a comparison of unusual repertoires from Malay, Kel A\u00efr, and Moroccan Berber musical cultures. We also ask whether unusual music is the result of unusual social organisation, cultural isolation, or as a marker of inter-societal pressures. There is weak evidence that the unusualness of music is predicted by kinship organisation and cultural isolation, but these predictors are heavily outweighed by finding that unusual songs are best predicted by knowing the society they come from - evidence that quantitatively supports the existence of musical style.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-18T01:49:19.080930","doi":null,"subjects":["Music","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hx8un\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/hx8un\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/hx8un","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hx8un","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_265"}

Efficacy trials show that mobile mental health apps can improve symptoms of some disorders, such as depression and anxiety, when compared to no treatment. Little is known, however, about the efficacy of mental health apps compared to standard-of-care treatments. These apps should not, therefore, be used as a replacement for established therapies. Furthermore, efficacy has only been shown in middle-aged adults, but not in youth or seniors, while men and racial monitories are underrepresented in the literature. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of apps in the very same populations that are underserved by existing mental health services. While efficacious for some, apps have rarely been shown to be effective in the real world beyond the context of carefully controlled studies. Yet, our analyses show that even without any peer-reviewed evidence, hundreds of \u2018mental health\u2019 apps are available to consumers and a large number of apps claim to be evidence-based without any peer-reviewed evidence for their efficacy or effectiveness.

Forty-two participants with diagnosed SAD were randomly allocated to eWMT (n = 21) or iCBT (n = 21).  Following diagnosis, participants completed social anxiety, depression, and generalised anxiety measures at pre- and post-interventions.  Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed a significant reduction in social anxiety, depression, and generalised anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-interventions for both eWMT and iCBT, with no advantage of iCBT over eWMT.  Overall, this proof-of-principle study shows that eWMT has the potential to be a stand-alone treatment for SAD.","tags":["randomized controlled trial","social phobia","computer-assisted therapy","cognitive behavioral therapy","social anxiety disorder"],"date":"2023-01-18T03:58:16.353570","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychology, other","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yp6qd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yp6qd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yp6qd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yp6qd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_267"}

We adapted a latent learning task that measures one\u2019s ability to learn and make judgments about associations among interconnected stimuli and evaluated performance across the lifespan. Younger adults generally showed evidence of successful latent learning and inference, and variability in judgment performance was explained by mnemonic discrimination ability. In a second experiment, we examined if performance can be improved for those with lower memory ability by separating overlapping object pairs across time, in an attempt to reduce memory interference during learning. We found that mnemonic discrimination ability interacted with training condition to improve judgment performance. This interaction was also captured using an artificial neural network simulation that varied training sequence and network capacity to predict judgment performance.

{"osf_id":"hgdn4","title":"What we do (not) know about the mechanisms underlying adaptive speech perception: A computational framework and review","description":"Speech from unfamiliar talkers can be difficult to comprehend initially. These difficulties tend to dissipate with exposure, sometimes within minutes or less. Adaptivity in response to unfamiliar input is now considered a fundamental property of speech perception, and research over the past two decades has made substantial progress in identifying its characteristics. The *mechanisms* underlying adaptive speech perception, however, remain unknown. Past work has attributed facilitatory effects of exposure to any one of three qualitatively different hypothesized mechanisms: (1) low-level, pre-linguistic, signal normalization, (2) changes in\/selection of linguistic representations, or (3) changes in post-perceptual decision-making. Direct comparisons of these hypotheses, or combinations thereof, have been lacking. We describe a general computational framework that---for the first time---implements all three mechanisms. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to derive predictions for experiments on perception from the acoustic properties of the stimuli. Using this approach, we find that---at the level of data analysis presently employed by most studies in the field---the signature results of common experimental paradigms do not distinguish between the three mechanisms. This highlights the need for a change in research practices, so that future experiments provide more informative results. We recommend specific changes to experimental paradigms and data analysis. All data and code for this study are shared via OSF, including the R markdown document that this article is generated from, and an R library that implements the models we present.","tags":["speech perception","linguistics","perceptual recalibration","cognitive science","computational model","accent adaptation"],"date":"2023-01-18T06:40:03.381800","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hgdn4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/hgdn4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/hgdn4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hgdn4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_270"}

The aim of this paper was to combine first- and third-person approaches to investigate whether the strategies individuals use during a working memory task are associated with specific task conditions, whether the strategies combine to form stable patterns, and whether the use of specific strategies is related to task accuracy. Thirty-one participants took part in an experiment in which they were instructed to remember colors, orientations, or positions of stimuli presented in a change detection task. After every few trials, participants took part in an in-depth phenomenological interview in which they described their experiences during the trial that immediately preceded the interview. Qualitative analysis revealed a set of 18 strategies that participants used while performing the task, which we divided into active and passive strategies of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Quantitative analysis revealed that while many strategies were used in all task conditions, some strategies and their combinations may be better suited to the specific task demands, while others are more general in nature. The results also suggest a distinction between strategies for encoding object identity and spatial features. Finally, our results did not provide robust evidence for a relationship between specific strategies and task accuracy.","tags":["visuo-spatial working memory","retrieval","phenomenology","strategies","maintenance","encoding"],"date":"2023-01-18T07:57:10.810706","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f3h4u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/f3h4u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/f3h4u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f3h4u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_271"}
{"osf_id":"wzy5b","title":"Probing the unimaginable: The impact of aphantasia on distinct domains of visual mental imagery and visual perception","description":"Different individuals experience varying degrees of vividness in their visual mental images. The distribution of these variations across different imagery domains, such as object shape, color, written words, faces, and spatial relationships, remains unknown. To address this issue, we conducted a study with 117 healthy participants who reported different levels of imagery vividness. Of these participants, 44 reported experiencing absent or nearly absent visual imagery, a condition known as \"aphantasia\". These individuals were compared to those with typical (N = 42) or unusually vivid (N = 31) imagery ability. We used an online version of the French-language Batt\u00e9rie Imagination-Perception (eBIP), which consists of tasks tapping each of the above-mentioned domains, both in visual imagery and in visual perception. We recorded the accuracy and response times (RTs) of participants' responses. Aphantasic participants reached similar levels of accuracy on all tasks compared to the other groups (Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA, BF = 0.02). However, their RTs were slower in both imagery and perceptual tasks (BF = 266), and they had lower confidence in their responses on perceptual tasks (BF = 7.78e5). A Bayesian regression analysis revealed that there was an inverse correlation between subjective vividness and RTs for the entire participant group: higher levels of vividness were associated with faster RTs. The pattern was similar in all the explored domains. The findings suggest that individuals with congenital aphantasia experience a slowing in processing visual information in both imagery and perception, but the precision of their processing remains unaffected. The observed performance pattern lends support to the hypotheses that congenital aphantasia is primarily a deficit of phenomenal consciousness, or that it employs alternative strategies other than visualization to access preserved visual information.","tags":["access consciousness","Visual perception","visual mental imagery","phenomenal consciousness","aphantasia"],"date":"2023-01-18T08:20:00.659961","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Imagery"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wzy5b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wzy5b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wzy5b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wzy5b","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_272"}

Given that psychopathy and sadism are highly similar in their conceptualizations, we compared prominent measures for both constructs (Psychopathy and Sadism subscales of the Short Dark Tetrad; short form of the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III; P7; Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies) in terms of structural properties (i.e., different confirmatory factor analyses) and their nomological networks (i.e., correlation difference tests concerning 51 criteria; overall agreement of nomological networks). In a sample of 594 participants (77% women, Mage = 28.4, SDage = 9.0), we found that latent single-factor and two-factor solutions of psychopathy and sadism items are almost equivalent, that the nomological networks of scales purportedly measuring either psychopathy or sadism are virtually identical, and that psychopathy scales were at least equivalent predictors of core characteristics of sadism.

Current military selection tests leave room for improvement when predicting individual differences in work-relevant outcomes and reducing adverse impact. We tested whether measures of attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence improved the prediction of training success above and beyond the current composite scores used by the U.S. Military. For air traffic controllers in training, attention control explained 9.1% of the unique variance in academic performance, whereas the Armed Forces Qualification Test explained 5.2% of the unique variance. For student naval aviators, incremental validity estimates were generally small and non-significant. For student naval flight officers, attention control measures explained 11.8% of the unique variance in aviation preflight indoctrination training performance and 4.3% of the unique variance in flight performance. In general, attention control measures improved training outcome classification accuracy, and the antisaccade and selective visual arrays tests of attention control demonstrated relatively small differences between majority and minority subgroups.","tags":["personnel selection","Armed Forces Qualification Test","Attention control","air traffic control","commonality analysis"],"date":"2023-01-18T13:25:27.592744","doi":null,"subjects":["Organizational Diversity","Learning","Attention","Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Selection and Placement","Memory","Reasoning","Problem Solving","Training and Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":null,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/re62k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/re62k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/re62k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/re62k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_278"}
{"osf_id":"naxvg","title":"Executive functions in psychopathy: A meta-analysis of inhibition, planning, shifting, and working memory performance","description":"Much research has focused on executive function (EF) impairments in psychopathy, a severe personality disorder characterized by a lack of empathy, antisocial behavior, and a disregard for social norms and moral values. However, it is still unclear to what extent these deficits are present and, more importantly, which EF domains are impaired. The current meta-analysis answers this question by synthesizing the results of 50 studies involving 5,694 participants from 12 different countries. Using multilevel random-effects models, we pooled effect sizes for four different EF domains: Inhibition, planning, shifting, and working memory. Our analyses yielded small deficits in inhibition and planning performance. However, a closer inspection of psychopathy factors indicated that EF deficits were specific to lifestyle\/antisocial traits, with impairments in inhibition, planning, and working memory. In contrast, the interpersonal\/affective traits of psychopathy were associated with better shifting performance. These findings suggest that EF deficits are not a key feature of psychopathy per se, but rather are related to antisociality. Potential brain correlates of these findings as well as implications for future research and treatment are discussed.","tags":["personality disorder","planning","shifting","executive function","psychopathy","meta-analysis","prefrontal cortex","working memory","antisocial behavior","inhibition"],"date":"2023-01-18T13:36:49.004972","doi":null,"subjects":["Forensic and Legal Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Personality Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/naxvg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/naxvg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/naxvg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/naxvg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_279"}
{"osf_id":"m8c4k","title":"Enhancing Precision in Human Neuroscience","description":"Human neuroscience has always been pushing the boundary of what is measurable. During the last decade, concerns about statistical power and replicability \u2013 in science in general, but also specifically in human neuroscience \u2013 have fueled an extensive debate. One important insight from this discourse is the need for larger samples, which naturally increases statistical power. An alternative is to increase the precision of measurements, which is the focus of this review. This option is often overlooked, even though statistical power benefits from increasing precision as much as from increasing sample size. Nonetheless, precision has always been at the heart of good scientific practice in human neuroscience, with researchers relying on lab traditions or rules of thumb to ensure sufficient precision for their studies. In this review, we encourage a more systematic approach to precision. We start by introducing measurement precision and its importance for well-powered studies in human neuroscience. Then, determinants for precision in a range of neuroscientific methods (MRI, M\/EEG, EMG, ECG, EDA, Eye-Tracking, Endocrinology, and Genetics) are elaborated. We end by discussing how a more systematic evaluation of precision and the application of respective insights can lead to an increase in reproducibility in human neuroscience.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-18T15:42:28.392617","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Meta-science","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m8c4k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/m8c4k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/m8c4k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m8c4k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_280"}
{"osf_id":"q5wx8","title":"What is the Basis of Ensemble Subset Selection?","description":"The visual system can rapidly calculate the ensemble statistics of a set of objects: e.g., people can easily estimate an average size of apples on a tree. To accomplish this, it is not always useful to summarize all the visual information. If there are various types of objects, the visual system should select a relevant subset: only apples, not leaves and branches. Here, we ask what kind of visual information makes a \u2018good\u2019 ensemble that can be selectively attended to provide an accurate summary estimate. We tested three candidate representations: basic features, preattentive object files, and full-fledged bound objects. In four experiments, we presented a target and several distractors\u2019 sets of differently colored objects. We found that conditions, where a target ensemble had at least one unique color (basic feature), provided ensemble averaging performance comparable to the baseline displays without distractors. When the target subset was defined as a conjunction of two colors or color-shape partly shared with distractors (so that they could be differentiated only as preattentive object files), subset averaging was also possible but less accurate than in the baseline and the feature conditions. Finally, performance was very poor when the target subset was defined by an exact feature relationship, such as in the spatial conjunction of two colors (spatially bound object). Overall, these results suggest that distinguishable features and, to a lesser degree, preattentive object files can serve as the representational basis of ensemble selection, while bound objects cannot.","tags":["ensemble summary statistics","binding problem.","subset selection","preattentive object file","ensemble selection"],"date":"2023-01-18T16:03:06.251795","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q5wx8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/q5wx8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/q5wx8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q5wx8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_281"}

We investigated whether these forgetting effects on inter-item associative memory occur only at specific or also at gist levels of representation. In two experiments, young adult participants (n = 90, and 86, respectively) encoded face-scene pairs and were then tested either immediately after encoding or following a 24-hour delay. Tests featured conjoint recognition judgments, in which participants were tasked with discriminating intact pairs from highly similar foils, less similar foils, and completely dissimilar foils. In both experiments, the 24-hour delay resulted in deficits in specific memory for face-scene pairs, as measured using multinomial-processing-tree analyses. In Experiment 1, gist memory was not affected by the 24-hour delay, but when associative memory was strengthened through pair repetition (Experiment 2), deficits in gist memory following a 24-hour delay were observed. Results suggest that specific representations of associations in episodic memory, and under some conditions gist representations, as well, are susceptible to forgetting across time.","tags":["memory","forgetting","repetition","specificity","fuzzy-trace theory","associative recognition"],"date":"2023-01-18T18:07:31.741913","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7dqze\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7dqze\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7dqze","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7dqze","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_282"}

The only continuous measure of depression provided in ABCD is the parent-report Child Behavior Checklist\u2019s DSM-5-Oriented Affective Problems scale (CBCL-Aff). It is important for depression research in the ABCD dataset that the CBCL-Aff is a valid measure of depression in this age group. We, therefore, tested the sensitivity and specificity of the CBCL-Aff for depression in the ABCD data. CBCL-Aff agreed with parent-report of children\u2019s symptoms but disagreed with child self-report. To resolve this disagreement, we further confirmed our results in two independent datasets, aged 9-12: the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and the Brazilian High Risk Cohort Study (BHRC). Both datasets provided clinician-report depression diagnoses, which we used as a gold standard. CBCL-Aff successfully predicted clinician-report diagnoses, supporting its validity as a continuous measure of depression. As parents and children disagreed on the child\u2019s symptoms, we discuss implications of using a parent-report only measure of child depression.","tags":["depression","measure validation","Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development","informant discrepancy","CBCL"],"date":"2023-01-18T19:49:55.113460","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/z956k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/z956k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/z956k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/z956k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_283"}

While research has established the neurotoxic effects of general alcohol consumption, binge drinking presents unique deleterious effects on the brain through the acute intoxication and withdrawal cycle. The detrimental impacts of binge drinking have been reported across a broad range of cognitive abilities in young adults, however, the research regarding its relationship to attention is mixed. This study investigates the relationship between binge drinking and attention performance in young adults. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that males and females are uniquely impacted by the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, so the present study tests the moderating role of sex, as well as the influence of earlier age of binge drinking onset. One-hundred and five university students were recruited for the study. After collecting socio-demographic, and alcohol use information, participants completed four cognitive tasks designed to measure the three attention networks according to the Attention Network Theory; alerting, orienting, and executive control. Linear hierarchical regressions were used to predict performance with binge drinking score, sex and age of first binge drinking session as predictors. Binge drinking, sex, and age of first binge drinking session did not predict attention impairment, nor did sex moderate the relationship, at least in the selected cognitive tasks. The tasks used to measure attention did not relate in the expected manner. While there were no differences in attention performance between those who binge drink and controls in this study, the relationship between binge drinking and attention impairments in young adults may be more nuanced and future research directions are suggested.

The Mediating Role of Nonattachment","description":"Peace of mind is an important affective well-being valued in Chinese culture. Mindfulness and self-compassion could potentially promote peace of mind. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects were not well understood. The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether nonattachment explained the benefits of mindfulness and self-compassion on peace of mind. A sample of 364 Chinese adults was recruited from WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform. Participants filled out an online survey including measures of dispositional mindfulness, self-compassion, nonattachment, and peace of mind. The results of correlation analyses revealed significant and positive associations among mindfulness, self-compassion, nonattachment, and peace of mind. Furthermore, nonattachment significantly mediated the associations between mindfulness and self-compassion with peace of mind. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that the relationships between mindfulness and self-compassion with nonattachment were stronger for women than for men. Gender did not moderate the direct effects of mindfulness and self-compassion on peace of mind, the relationship between nonattachment and peace of mind, and the mediating effects of mindfulness and self-compassion on peace of mind through nonattachment. These findings suggest that nonattachment may be a potential mechanism by which mindfulness and self-compassion promote peace of mind among Chinese adults. If the mediating effects are confirmed in future longitudinal and experimental studies, mindfulness and self-compassion interventions can emphasize nonattachment to optimize their effects on peace of mind. It may also be important to tailor mindfulness and self-compassion training for men and women given the gender differences in the relationships between mindfulness and self-compassion with nonattachment.","tags":["Meditation","Non-attachment","Inner peace","Self-compassion","Mechanism"],"date":"2023-01-19T02:48:27.558108","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4vxzf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4vxzf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4vxzf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4vxzf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_289"}

However, the PRISMA guidelines are not sufficient for reporting the screening phase in a reproducible manner. Text screening with active learning is an iterative process, but the labeling decisions and the training of the active learning model can happen independently of each other in time. So it is not trivial to store the data from both events so that you can still know which iteration of the model was used for each labeling decision. Moreover, many iterations of the active learning model will be trained throughout the screening process, producing an enormous amount of data (think of many gigabytes or even terabytes of data), and machine learning models are continually becoming larger. Together this can add up to an undesirable amount of data when naively storing all the data produced at every iteration of the active learning pipeline. This article clarifies the steps in an active learning-aided screening process and what data is produced at every step. We show how this data can be stored efficiently in terms of size. Most notably, the data produced by the model is where we need to strike a balance between reproducibility and storage size. Finally, we created the RDAL-Checklist (Reproducibility and Data storage for Active Learning-aided systematic reviews \u2013 checklist) that helps users and creators of active learning software make their screening process reproducible.","tags":["Active Learning","Open Science","Reproducibility","Meta-Analysis","Transparency","Data Storage","Systematic Review"],"date":"2023-01-19T08:52:23.038743","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g93zf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/g93zf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/g93zf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g93zf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_292"}

Latent profile and latent transition analyses revealed four motivational profiles among students: Positively ambitious (high competence and value beliefs, low costs, T1: 34%\/ T2: 32%), Struggling ambitious (high competence and value beliefs, high costs, T1: 25%\/T2: 25%), Indifferent (low competence and value beliefs, low costs, T1: 22%\/T2: 21%), and Maladaptive (low competence and value beliefs, high costs, 19%\/22%). Although some fluctuations were detected in profile memberships within the school year, most of the students (80%) displayed stable mathematics motivation across ninth grade. Students who remained Positively ambitious also performed well, aspired for an education that required high mathematical skills, and experienced the least emotional distress, whereas students in the most negative motivational profile (Maladaptive) showed the opposite patterns. However, students who experienced high math-related costs, despite having positive value beliefs, performance, and aspirations (i.e., Struggling ambitious), also experienced one of the highest levels of study-related exhaustion and depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of exhaustion and depressive symptoms were systematically associated with negative motivational transitions in general (i.e., moving from Positively ambitious to Struggling ambitious, or from Indifferent to Maladaptive), highlighting the importance of reducing perceived study-related costs in schools and supporting students' well-being.","tags":["Motivation","Expectancy-Value Theory","Mathematics","Latent Transition Analysis","Well-being"],"date":"2023-01-19T10:45:23.502786","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ugrpy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ugrpy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ugrpy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ugrpy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_293"}

These measures are often treated as roughly interchangeable although, to date, it is unclear whether they are indeed comparable. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to investigate whether and to which extent measures of political violence can be used interchangeably. We conducted an online survey and collected participants\u2019 responses on two direct measures of attitudes towards political violence, two indirect measures, and one behavioural measure. Results revealed that direct measures in the form of vignette approaches were able to differentiate between different kinds of political violence, whereas broader direct measures were fuzzier in their outcomes. We further found that indirect and behavioural measures for political violence were difficult to operationalise. The endorsement experiment as an indirect measure appeared most promising in this regard, although it did not correspond perfectly to the results of the direct measures. Disassembling measurements of political violence, we may contribute to improve quantitative research on radicalism, radicalization, and extremism.","tags":["extremism","measurement","Bayes Factors","political attitudes","measurement of political attitudes","methodology","radicalism","radicalization","measurement of political violence","political violence"],"date":"2023-01-19T10:48:09.482916","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Psychology, other","Psychometrics","Politics","Violence and Aggression","Intragroup Processes","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/k83b4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/k83b4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/k83b4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/k83b4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_294"}

In each of these grammars only sequential order information marks the hierarchical structure. Although closely related, these grammars differ from a formal point of view: the Fibonacci grammar is perfectly scale-free and presents an isomorphism between its surface and derivational properties while the Skip grammar, although also self-similar, does not present this isomorphism. Our goal was to explore the influence of these formal differences on the extraction of hierarchical structure by the participants. To this end, we implemented these grammars in a serial reaction time task. The results show that in both the Fibonacci grammar and the Skip grammar, participants elaborated a hierarchical structure from the signal. This suggests the involvement of at least partially similar mechanisms during processing. However, some processing differences remained that cannot be explained by the hypotheses proposed so far regarding the processing of strings generated by L-systems. We hypothesize that these effects would be due to the self-similarity of the signal which would act as a reinforcement of the structure elaborated by the participants.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-19T14:59:30.579235","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Concepts and Categories","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mre4h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mre4h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mre4h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mre4h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_295"}

Over time, studies have tended to employ the latter method on the basis of a pervasive belief that the four trial types are independent of one another. Inspection of the literature shows no direct evidence to support this claim and one experiment contradicting it. I conducted a more general investigation of this question using a large existing dataset of 1688 participants who completed one of 41 distinct IRAPs in 17 domains. Scores for each trial-type within each IRAP were correlated with one another in order to assess their independence. 27% of correlations were significantly different from zero. 74% of IRAPs demonstrated at least one detectable correlation among its trial-types. A multi-level meta-analysis demonstrated that IRAP trial-types are on average significantly correlated (r = .21, p &lt; .00000000000001), albeit with significant heterogeneity between domains. In addition to the existing experimental evidence, this provides large scale correlational evidence that against the claim that IRAP\u2019s trial-types are in general independent. Based on the available evidence, researchers should start from the default assumption that the trial types are non-independent, and therefore that the IRAP should be analyzed as a single score. Recommendations for how scoring decisions should be made are provided, along with more general recommendations for ensuring the replicability of findings.","tags":["implicit relational assessment procedure","measurement","implicit social cognition","relational frame theory"],"date":"2023-01-19T15:10:13.732091","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Individual Differences","Assessment","Attitudes and Persuasion","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4gsxq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4gsxq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4gsxq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4gsxq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_296"}
{"osf_id":"ypd45","title":"Meta-learning environment-specific learning rates","description":"In everyday life, people often have to switch back and forth between different environments that come with different problems and volatilities. While volatile environments require fast learning (i.e., high learning rate), stable environments call for lower learning rates. Previous studies have shown that people can adapt their learning rate while remaining in an environment, but it remains unclear whether they can also learn to associate different learning rates to different environments, and instantaneously retrieve their environment-specific learning rate settings when revisiting these environments. Here, we hypothesised that people can switch back and forth between two different environments and learn to use different, optimal learning rates for each. Second, we tested whether people would also show an echo of this learning rate difference in a test phase where both environments had the same volatility. We used optimality simulations and Bayesian hierarchical modelling to demonstrate, across three experiments (total N = 273), that people can alternate between two different learning rates, on a trial-by-trial basis, when switching back and forth between two two-armed bandit tasks in two different environments (i.e., casinos) that differ in volatility. Results from the test phase further suggest that participants learned to attribute these different learning rates to their respective environments, as there remained a small difference in learning rate and choice reversal around the first reward contingency switch. We conclude that people can flexibly adapt and learn to associate different learning rates to different environments, on a trial-by-trial basis, offering important insights for developing theories of meta-learning and context-specific control.","tags":["learning rate","reinforcement learning","context-specificity","meta-learning"],"date":"2023-01-19T15:10:52.244070","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ypd45\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ypd45\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ypd45","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ypd45","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_297"}
{"osf_id":"3zbe2","title":"The cognitive load effect in working memory: Refreshing the empirical landscape, removing outdated explanations","description":"Maintaining information in working memory often competes with concurrent processing of other information. This is reflected in the cognitive load effect, referring to the observation that processing tasks with a higher cognitive load result in lower memory performance. The cognitive load effect has been shown on many occasions in complex span tasks, which combine maintenance of memory items with a processing demand interleaved in between the presentation of the memory items. Two models of working memory, the Time-Based ResourceSharing (TBRS) model, and the Serial Order in a Box \u2013 Complex Span (SOB-CS) model, offer competing explanations for the cognitive load effect. Both lead to the prediction that the cognitive load effect should also be found in the Brown-Peterson task, in which the processing demand is inserted after the presentation of all of the memory items. Across three experiments, we show this prediction to be wrong. In addition, we uncovered (1) that the duration of the processing episodes has no impact on the presence or absence of a cognitive load effect, and (2) that the duration of free time, a variable intimately tied to cognitive load manipulation, affects memory performance in the same way with and without a processing demand: Free time is beneficial for memory when inserted in between the presentation of the memory items, but not when added after the presentation of the entire memory set. These results imply that both current explanations of the cognitive load effect are wrong. We propose several alternatives to account for these results.","tags":["free time","Brown-Peterson task","cognitive load","removal","working memory","refreshing","complex span task","cognitive load effect"],"date":"2023-01-19T16:50:18.230228","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3zbe2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3zbe2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3zbe2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3zbe2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_298"}

The most commonly used methods in the field for analyzing repeated measures data, for studying variation and stability in individual change, and for investigating how individual level outcomes relate to the group may not be the most robust available. In this methods tutorial, we introduce a state-of-the-art longitudinal data analysis method: individual growth curve modeling. We describe the various uses for individual growth curve models (IGCM) in comparison with other cross-sectional or single-subject analytical methods, define important terms related to such models that describe outcome variable Y at time t, and show how IGCM can be used to analyze variables at the individual and group levels simultaneously. In our tutorial, we provide a worked example of IGCM that draws on a dataset of L2 students\u2019 classroom disengagement and use R to exemplify the necessary steps for conducting IGC modeling. Through this example, we demonstrate how IGCM are especially suited to data structured on multiple levels, where repeated measures varying across time are nested within individuals, and where both time-variant and time-invariant measures are of interest. We further demonstrate how, in addition to examining changes over time in the outcome variable for the same individual using repeated measures, IGCM can also capture individual differences in those changes. We conclude with a brief review of how such models have been used recently across a selective sample of research domains in applied linguistics.","tags":["longitudinal analysis","growth curve modeling","time-varying predictors","intra-individual\/inter-individual change"],"date":"2023-01-19T20:03:29.516188","doi":"10.1016\/j.rmal.2023.100043","subjects":["Applied Linguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/b3yrg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/b3yrg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/b3yrg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/b3yrg","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.rmal.2023.100043","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_300"}

Through in silico interventions, we simulated the evolution of the BPD system by manipulating: 1) the connectivity strength between nodes (i.e., vulnerability), 2) the external disturbances (i.e., stress) and 3) the predisposition of symptoms to manifest. Similarly, using network analysis we evaluated the effect of an in vivo group psychotherapy to detect the symptoms modified by the intervention. We found that a network with greater connectivity strength between nodes (more vulnerable) showed a higher number of activated symptoms than networks with less strength connectivity. We also found that increases in stress affected more vulnerable networks compared to less vulnerable ones, while decreases in stress revealed a hysteresis effect in the most strongly connected networks. The in silico intervention to symptom alleviation revealed the relevance of nodes related to difficulty in anger regulation, nodes which were also detected as impacted by the in vivo intervention.

These intrusive memories are one of the hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder. Intrusive memories or flashbacks are typically described as visual, and their vividness predicts the severity of PTSD. If visual imagery is central to the development and continuation of flashbacks then people without visual imagery (aphantasia) should experience less, or different, intrusive memories. To test this, a group of individuals with aphantasia and a group with visual imagery underwent a lab-based PTSD model: the trauma film paradigm. Aphantasic individuals reported fewer intrusions immediately after watching the traumatic film, as well as fewer intrusions in a digital diary app over the course of a week. Despite the significant reduction in intrusive memories, aphantasic individuals still reported having some intrusions, however, the sensory qualities of these intrusions were markedly different from individuals with visual imagery. While individuals with visual imagery reported their intrusions as being mostly visual, aphantasic individuals reported mostly verbal intrusions. These findings demonstrate that visual imagery is related to the number of intrusive memories experienced after witnessing a traumatic event, which may have important implications for the development of PTSD. Further, it does appear that aphantasic individuals can experience intrusions, albeit less frequently and in a different format than people with visual imagery.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-19T23:09:05.709467","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Imagery","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7zqfe\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7zqfe\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7zqfe","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7zqfe","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_302"}

We found that increased BMI was associated with significantly lower cortical thickness and lower gray matter density in the right OFC, and in particular its medial aspect. For change in appetite, in contrast, we did not find any significant association with OFC morphometry, nor with OFC white matter connections. Bayesian model comparisons further suggested that BMI alone, but not change in appetite or a combination of both explained variance in cortical thickness of the right OFC. We further found strong to decisive evidence for the absence of an effect of BMI and appetite for most other analyses, including surface area and DTI measures of all OFC regions.

{"osf_id":"v86bx","title":"The effect of reward prediction errors on subjective affect depends on outcome valence and decision context","description":"The valence of an individual's emotional response to an event is often thought to depend on their prior expectations for the event: better-than-expected outcomes produce positive affect and worse-than-expected outcomes produce negative affect. In recent years, this hypothesis has been instantiated within influential computational models of subjective affect that assume the valence of affect is driven by reward prediction errors. However, there remain a number of open questions regarding this association. In this project, we investigated the moderating effects of outcome valence and decision context (Experiment 1: free vs. forced choices; Experiment 2: trials with versus trials without counterfactual feedback) on the effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect. We conducted two online experiments (N = 300 in total) of general-population samples recruited via Prolific to complete a risky decision-making task with embedded high-resolution sampling of subjective affect. Hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling revealed that both outcome amount and reward prediction errors influenced subjective affect, but that the effects of reward prediction errors were moderated by both outcome valence and decision context. Specifically, we found evidence that only negative reward prediction errors (worse-than-expected outcomes) influenced subjective affect, with no significant effect of positive reward prediction errors (better-than-expected outcomes). Moreover, these effects were only apparent on trials in which participants made a choice freely (but not on forced-choice trials) and when counterfactual feedback was absent (but not when counterfactual feedback was present). These results deepen our understanding of the effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-20T05:04:26.552684","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v86bx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/v86bx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/v86bx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v86bx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_306"}

Given the difficulty in reaching consensus for most items, subsequently this was changed to eliminate items that received &lt;5 votes, after which the item receiving the most votes would be selected.\nDiscussions and Conclusions: This was an important process that received considerable interest and buy-in across the NSW AOD sector.

To address this gap, this study investigates the relationship between the degree of multi-locational work with location features and worker outcomes, including engagement, creativity, and well-being. Using a sample of 2603 survey responses from the Tokyo metropolitan area, the results show that multi-locational work is positively associated with all three outcomes, particularly creativity. This study also finds that non-work activity rate and location feature differences partially mediate the relationship between multi-locational work and creativity, while non-work activity rate partially mediates the relationship between multi-locational work and worker well-being. This study provides insight into the varied pathways behind the associations of multi-locational work and worker outcomes essential for sustainable prosperity.","tags":["multi-locational work","flexible work arrangements","well-being","creativity","engagement"],"date":"2023-01-20T07:30:50.484052","doi":null,"subjects":["Employee Behavior and Motivation","Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Work-life Quality","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Work-life Balance"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8g3fy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8g3fy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8g3fy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8g3fy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_309"}

Power decreases in the electroencephalogram in the alpha-beta band are consistently found prior to picture onset, suggesting they could reflect conceptual and lexical retrieval. However, this effect disappears in nonverbal contexts, which provide semantic information but lack structural composition. The present electroencephalography study aimed at investigating the behavioral and neural effect of syntactic structure on context-driven word production. Participants performed context-driven picture naming, where contexts were manipulated for structure (structured vs. unstructured, e.g., \u201cleaves\u2013fall\u2013from\u201d vs \u201clarva\u2013caterpillar\u2013cocoon\u201d) and context constraint (constraining vs. nonconstraining, as above). Pictures were named faster in constraining relative to nonconstraining contexts in both structured and unstructured conditions. Interestingly, structure in itself showed no behavioral facilitation in either constraint condition. The neural findings revealed a contrasting pattern. Power decreases in the alpha-beta band were observed following structured constraining compared to nonconstraining contexts, replicating previous findings, but this pattern was absent in the unstructured condition. We suggest that the presence of structure enables the selection of the activated morpho-syntactic features needed for the word\u2019s syntactic integration with the sentential context before the target picture appears. The electrophysiological findings suggest that alpha-beta power decreases reflect concept and lemma retrieval as well as the selection of the relevant morpho-syntactic properties that receive activation from the lemma.","tags":["syntactic structure","sentential constraint","language production","word list","prediction","neural oscillations","context-driven word planning","anticipation"],"date":"2023-01-20T09:39:17.692055","doi":null,"subjects":["Linguistics","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r73k8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r73k8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r73k8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r73k8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_310"}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether continuous HbA1c levels, and HbA1c polygenic risk scores (HbA1c-PRS) significantly associate with worse brain health independent of T2D diagnosis (vs. not), by examining brain structure and cognitive test scores phenotypes.\nMethods: Using cross-sectional UK Biobank data (n=39,283), we tested whether HbA1c and\/or HbA1c-PRS were significantly associated with multiple cognitive test scores. We also assessed associations with brain imaging phenotypes including grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, white matter tract integrity and frontal lobe GM. We adjusted for potential confounders of age (at MRI), sex, deprivation, education, genotyping chip, 8 genetic principal components for population stratification, smoking, alcohol intake, cholesterol medication, body mass index (BMI), T2D, and APOE e4 dosage. \nResults: We found an association between higher HbA1c levels and poorer performance on symbol digit substitution scores (standardised beta [\u03b2] = -0.022 p = 0.001) in the fully adjusted model. We also found an association between higher HbA1c levels and worse brain MRI phenotypes of GM (\u03b2 = -0.026, p &lt; 0.001), whole brain volume (\u03b2 = -0.072, p = 0.0113), and general factor for frontal lobe of GM (\u03b2 = -0.022, p &lt; 0.001) in fully adjusted models. HbA1c-PRS score was significantly associated with GM volume in the fully adjusted model (\u03b2 = -0.010, p = 0.0113), however when adjusted for HbA1c levels the association was not significant.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that measured HbA1c correlates to some extent with poorer cognitive and structural brain health, and HbA1c-PRS does not add significant information to this, however further studies in diverse populations are needed to confirm these results.","tags":["UK Biobank","Cognitive","Diabetes","Brain Health","Hba1C","Brain imaging"],"date":"2023-01-20T10:56:45.508913","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry","Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rywn3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rywn3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rywn3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rywn3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_312"}

In this paper we focus on material interior environments that are infused with smart technology, which we call ambient smart environments (ASEs). ASEs can track their users, gather data, and intervene in shaping everyday opportunities for action. We argue that a traditional approach to theorising technology, using the language of affordances, focusing on what technology allows us to do, fails to fully capture the potential role ASEs could come to play in people\u2019s lives. This is because a primary design characteristic of ASEs is the drive to dissolve\ntraditional user interfaces, and to have the technology recede into the background. We argue for a view of ASEs as a meta-affordance, actively shaping their user\u2019s field of affordances. To develop our account, we draw on a wide range of theoretical cognitive science, including The Skilled Intentionality Framework and the Free Energy Principle. We argue that the true potential of ASEs lies in their capacity to intervene on an agent\u2019s field of affordances, thus playing an integral role in the agent\u2019s capacity to minimise free energy effectivity.","tags":["Metacognition","Affordances","Ambient technology","Smart Technology","Free Energy Principle"],"date":"2023-01-20T10:58:50.766456","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/k34ac\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/k34ac\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/k34ac","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/k34ac","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_313"}

{"osf_id":"y57z3","title":"Assessing the roles of shape prototypicality and sexual dimorphism in ratings of the trustworthiness of faces","description":"Perceptions of the trustworthiness of faces predict important social outcomes, including economic exchange and criminal sentencing decisions. However, the specific facial characteristics that drive trustworthiness perceptions remain poorly understood. Here we investigated this issue by exploring possible relationships between ratings of the trustworthiness of face images and objective assessments of two aspects of face shape that researchers have previously suggested are important for perceptions of trustworthiness: distinctiveness and sexual dimorphism. We found that faces with more distinctive shapes were rated as less trustworthy. By contrast, sexual dimorphism of face shape was not significantly correlated with trustworthiness ratings. These results suggest that distinctiveness of face shape plays a more important role in trustworthiness perceptions than does sexual dimorphism and suggest that perceptions of trustworthiness may stem, at least in part, from the \u2018anomalous-is-bad\u2019 stereotype.

Professional freelance software developers together with computer science students addressed perceptions of risk and security during development.

{"osf_id":"kzudc","title":"Cognitive effort investment: Does disposition become action?","description":"Contrary to the law of less work, individuals with high levels of need for cognition and self-control tend to choose harder tasks more often. While both traits can be integrated into a core construct of cognitive effort investment, the processes underlying this tendency remain unclear. A plausible explanation is that these individuals intend to avoid the feeling of boredom during easy tasks. If this were the case, they would be less likely to increase their effort based on expected payoff, but rather based on increasing demand. In the present study, we measured actual effort investment on multiple dimensions, i.e., subjective load, reaction time, accuracy, early and late frontal midline theta power, N2 and P3 amplitude, and pupil dilation. In a sample of N = 148 participants, we examined the relationship of dispositional cognitive effort investment and effort indices during a flanker and an n-back task with varying demand and payoff. In both tasks, effort indices were sensitive to demand and partly to payoff. The analyses revealed no main effect of cognitive effort investment, but interaction effects with payoff for reaction time (n-back and flanker task) and P3 amplitude (n-back task) and demand for early frontal midline theta power (flanker task). Taken together, our results do not support the notion that individuals with high levels of cognitive effort investment exert effort more efficiently. However, the notion that these individuals exert effort regardless of payoff is partly supported. This may further our understanding of the conditions under which person-situation interactions occur, i.e. the conditions under which situations determine effort investment in goal-directed behavior more than personality, and vice versa.","tags":["eyetracking","demand","frontal midline theta power","flanker","n-back","electroencephalogram","payoff","N2","pupil dilation","EEG","cognitive effort investment","need for cognition","P3"],"date":"2023-01-20T12:25:14.339200","doi":null,"subjects":["Motivational Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Individual Differences","Behavioral Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kzudc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kzudc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kzudc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kzudc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_317"}

In this large-scale, population-based study of adults, we applied network analysis to study the relationship between environmental factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and wellbeing. We estimated networks with overall mental health nodes and individual symptoms to assess both broad- and fine-grained associations between environmental factors and mental health. Finally, we conducted an out-of-sample replication in an independent large-scale sample to assess the robustness of our results. Across 31,000 adults randomly sampled from the Norwegian population, we found evidence of key associations between environmental characteristics and mental health. Recent discrimination and unsupportive social environments were strongly associated with lower population wellbeing and higher levels of mental illness symptoms, respectively. The most strongly connected variables in the networks were environmental factors, including perceived problems with crime, violence, or vandalism in the residential area, worrying about violence or threats when outside, and problems with noise or contamination at home. Substantial variation in population mental health was explained by environmental factors included in the networks. Replicability of the results was excellent and indicative of strong robustness of the results across samples. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental factors, such as the social environment, housing satisfaction, and residential area characteristics, for multiple aspects of population mental health. We identify several environmental factors which represent potentially useful targets for future studies and public health efforts seeking to improve mental health in the general population.","tags":["mental health","network analysis","population mental health","environmental factors","wellbeing","depressive symptoms","anxiety symptoms"],"date":"2023-01-20T13:22:09.394098","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Mental Health"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3wb79\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3wb79\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3wb79","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3wb79","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_318"}

Attempts to infer psychological states through specific behaviours include the observation of walking speed, exercise intensity, and interpersonal synchrony. An increasingly accessible method of measuring magnitude and frequency of specific behaviours is accelerometry, a method that is frequently used in health research. The potential for accelerometer data to infer psychological states was highlighted early in the development of modern devices. To make the link between accelerometer data and Psychological state thought must be given to the chain of causation between the construct of interest and the output of the device. The purposes of this paper are to introduce accelerometry as a method to psychologists; to present some of the hardware (e.g. sampling rate) and software (e.g. data reduction) configuration variables and the ways in which they can influence results; to recommend methods to identify and communicate the chain of inference between constructs and outcomes; and to present a guide for running and reporting psychological studies using accelerometers.

{"osf_id":"8qwmy","title":"A narrative systematic review of changes in mental health symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic","description":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns regarding population-wide impacts on mental health. Existing work on the psychological impacts of disaster has identified the potential for multiple response trajectories, with resilience as likely as the development of chronic psychopathology. Early reviews of mental health during the pandemic suggested elevated prevalence rates of multiple forms of psychopathology, but were limited by largely cross-sectional approaches. We conducted a systematic review of studies that prospectively assessed pre- to peri-pandemic changes in symptoms of psychopathology to investigate potential mental health changes associated with the onset of the pandemic (PROSPERO #CRD42021255042). A total of 97 studies were included, covering symptom clusters including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fear, anxiety, depression, and general distress. Changes in psychopathology symptoms varied by symptom dimension and sample characteristics. OCD, anxiety, depression, and general distress symptoms tended to increase from pre- to peri-pandemic. An increase in fear was limited to medically vulnerable participants, and findings for PTSD were mixed. Pre-existing mental health diagnoses unexpectedly were not associated with symptom exacerbation, except in the case of OCD. Young people generally showed the most marked symptom increases, although this pattern was reversed in some samples. Women in middle adulthood in particular demonstrated a considerable increase in anxiety and depression. We conclude that mental health responding during the pandemic varied as a function of both symptom cluster and sample characteristics. Variability in responding should therefore be a key consideration guiding future research and intervention.","tags":["obsessive-compulsive disorder","depression","internalizing","anxiety","longitudinal","preregistered","systematic review","post-traumatic stress disorder","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-01-20T17:43:05.421752","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Psychology","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8qwmy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8qwmy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8qwmy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8qwmy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_323"}
{"osf_id":"7bk32","title":"Gating by alpha band inhibition revised: a case for a secondary control mechanism","description":"In recent decades there has been a growing interest in the role of neuronal oscillations in the alpha band and how they support cognition. It is clear from intracranial animal recordings, that alpha oscillations are associated with inhibition as increases in alpha power co-occur with a decrease in neuronal activity. Nevertheless, several findings have put into question whether alpha-band oscillations, in general, can be controlled in a top-down manner to suppress visual distractors. Also, it has been questioned whether alpha oscillations can exercise gain control in the early visual cortex.

This view is compatible with perceptual load theory and biased competition, where distractor suppression is an indirect consequence of engagement.

{"osf_id":"yfp45","title":"Social Media Sensitivity","description":"Research on the effects of social media on wellbeing has been equivocal. Social media impacts people\u2019s wellbeing in different ways, but relatively little is known about why this is the case. Here we introduce the construct of \u201cSocial Media Sensitivity\u201d to understand how social media\u2019s effects on wellbeing differs across people and the contexts in which these platforms are used. In a month-long large-scale intensive longitudinal study (total n = 1,632; total number of observations = 120,599), we examined for whom and under which circumstances social media was associated with positive and negative changes in social and affective wellbeing. Applying a combination of frequentist and Bayesian multilevel models, we found that the effects of social media on wellbeing were heterogenous, but most people generally experienced a negative social media sensitivity in terms of changes to their loneliness, stress levels, affect and feelings of being accepted. People with psychologically vulnerable dispositions (e.g., those who were depressed, lonely, not satisfied with life) tended to experience a heightened negative social media sensitivity in comparison to people who were not psychologically vulnerable. People also experienced heightened negative social media sensitivities when in certain types of places (e.g., in social places, in nature) and while around certain types of people (e.g., around family members, close ties), as compared to using social media at home or when alone. Our results suggest that an understanding of the effects of social media on wellbeing should account for the psychological dispositions of social media users, and the physical and social contexts surrounding their use. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of social media sensitivity for scholars, policymakers, and those in the technology industry.","tags":["heterogenous effects","social media","personality","wellbeing","social context","physical context"],"date":"2023-01-20T18:16:29.109137","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Personality and Situations","Quantitative Methods","Individual Differences","Psychology, other","Quantitative Psychology","Computational Modeling","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Well-being","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yfp45\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yfp45\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yfp45","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yfp45","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_325"}

Leading accounts ground punishment for negligence in two well-known, general phenomena: outcome bias and lack of due care. We isolate and verify each of these influences. Additionally, however, we find that people punish a feature unique to cases of negligence: the failure to recall relevant information at the right time. In other words, people punish mere failures of thought. Specifically, in line with the predictions of outcome bias we find that people punish negligent actors more when their negligence leads to harmful instead of harmless outcomes (Experiment 1).  But they deem punishment for negligence to be successful when the actor ceases to be negligent, rather than the harm ceasing to occur (Experiment 2). Supporting the lack of due care proposal, we find that people punish negligent actors more when they fail to take reasonable antecedent precautions (Experiment 3) or when they demonstrate insufficient care towards their task (Experiment 4). Finally, supporting the mere failure of thought hypothesis, we find that people punish negligent actors more when they fail to bring relevant information to mind at the right time (Experiment 5), even compared to cases where the information is supplied by an exogenous reminder (Experiment 6). Taken together, our findings suggest that punishment for negligence is determined by multiple factors: bad outcome, lack of due care, and the mere failure of thought.","tags":["punishment","lack of due care","negligence","failure of thought","outcome bias"],"date":"2023-01-20T19:18:22.055397","doi":null,"subjects":["Moral Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/59fer\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/59fer\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/59fer","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/59fer","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_326"}

{"osf_id":"2a7hb","title":"Why doesn't executive function training improve academic achievement? Rethinking individual differences, relevance, and engagement from a contextual framework","description":"Performance on lab assessments of executive functions predicts academic achievement and other positive life outcomes. A primary goal of research on executive functions has been to design interventions that improve outcomes like academic achievement by improving executive functions. These interventions typically involve extensive practice on abstract lab-based tasks and lead to improvements on these practiced tasks. However, interventions rarely improve performance on non-practiced tasks and rarely benefit outcomes like academic achievement. Contemporary frameworks of executive function development suggest that executive functions develop and are engaged within personal, social, historical, and cultural contexts. Abstract lab-based tasks do not well-capture the real-world contexts that require executive functions and should not be expected to provide generalized benefits outside of the lab. We propose a perspective for understanding individual differences in performance on executive function assessments that focuses on contextual influences on executive functions. We extend this contextual approach to training executive function engagement, rather than training executive functions directly. First, interventions should incorporate task content that is contextually relevant to the targeted outcome. Second, interventions should encourage engaging executive functions through reinforcement and contextual relevance, which may better translate to real-world outcomes than training executive functions directly. While such individualized executive functions interventions do not address systemic factors that greatly impact outcomes like academic achievement, given the extensive resources devoted to improving executive functions, we hypothesize that interventions designed to encourage children\u2019s engagement of executive functions hold more promise for impacting real-world outcomes than interventions designed to improve executive function capacities.","tags":["Executive Functions","Cognitive Training","Cognitive Development"],"date":"2023-01-20T20:58:27.058503","doi":"10.1080\/15248372.2022.2160723","subjects":["Life Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2a7hb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2a7hb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2a7hb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2a7hb","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/15248372.2022.2160723","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_329"}
{"osf_id":"vw96u","title":"Why is Concealment Associated with Health and Wellbeing? An Investigation of Fifteen Potential Mechanisms","description":"Rationale: Many members of stigmatized groups face health and wellbeing deficits relative to their non-stigmatized peers. Ample evidence suggests that one method used by some members of stigmatized groups to manage the stigma they face\u2014concealing their stigmatized identities\u2014may contribute to these health and wellbeing disparities. However, precisely why concealment may contribute to these disparities is less clear. \nObjective: The present work seeks to identify and distinguish between plausible explanations for why concealment may contribute to worse health and wellbeing.\nMethods: In the present work, we explore a large number of plausible mechanisms that may explain why concealment is associated with worse health and wellbeing. In three studies (N = 2,304) using cross-sectional (Studies 1 and 2) and longitudinal (Study 3) methods, participants were recruited from an online recruitment pool (Studies 1-3) and from an institutional recruitment pool (Study 2). Participants reported on their concealment, health and wellbeing, and constructs related to plausible explanations for the relationships between concealment and health and wellbeing.\nResults: We find that concealment is associated with worse health and wellbeing, with generally small effect sizes. We further find that lower feelings of belonging, less social support, and lower self-esteem are the most plausible mechanisms for explaining why concealment is associated with worse health and wellbeing. When between- and within-subjects effects were distinguishable (i.e., Study 3), we observed only between-subjects relationships.\nConclusion: Because people\u2019s choices to engage in self-protection through concealment should be respected, potential avenues for intervention to reduce minority health disparities may be more appropriately targeted at the mechanisms that account for why concealment may undermine health and wellbeing than at concealment itself. The present work makes strides towards identifying those mechanisms and thus towards addressing them.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-20T21:13:48.166294","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vw96u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vw96u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vw96u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vw96u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_330"}
{"osf_id":"7pga2","title":"Computational rationality approaches to arbitrating models of cognition: a case study using perceptual metacognition","description":"Perceptual confidence results from a metacognitive process which evaluates how likely our percepts are to be correct. Many competing models of perceptual metacognition enjoy strong empirical support. Arbitrating these models traditionally proceeds via researchers conducting experiments and then fitting several models to the data collected. However, such a process often includes conditions or paradigms that may not best arbitrate competing models: Many models make similar predictions under typical experimental conditions. Consequently, many experiments are needed, collectively (sub-optimally) sampling the space of conditions to compare models. Here, instead, we introduce a variant of optimal experimental design which we call a computational rationality approach to generative models of cognition, using perceptual metacognition as a case study. Instead of designing experiments and post-hoc specifying models, we began with comprehensive model comparison among four competing generative models for perceptual metacognition, drawn from literature. By simulating a simple experiment under each model, we identified conditions where these models made maximally diverging predictions for confidence. We then presented these conditions to human observers, and compared the models\u2019 capacity to predict choices and confidence. Results revealed two surprising findings: (1) two models previously reported to differently predict confidence to different degrees, with one predicting better than the other, turned out to predict confidence in a direction opposite to previous findings; and (2) two other models previously reported to equivalently predict confidence showed stark differences. Our findings reveal the promise of this computational rationality approach to maximizing experimental utility in model arbitration while minimizing the number of experiments necessary to reveal the winning model, both for perceptual metacognition and in many other domains.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-20T22:03:08.548137","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7pga2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7pga2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7pga2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7pga2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_331"}
{"osf_id":"qu3ay","title":"Capturing the complete language environment: What could children learn by 'listening in'?","description":"Inspired by qualitative studies typically limited to child-directed speech, we develop a coding scheme designed to characterize all utterances accessible to two English-learning children in terms of their relative utility for word-learning. We focus in particular on contributors to referential transparency as a well-established and meaningful dimension of language learnability in context. These include the spatial positions of the caregivers and children, the caregivers' use of gaze or gesture to illustrate their meaning, the child's visual access to the caregiver or to the referent of the utterance, and the caregiver's use of modified prosody. As a proof of concept, we apply this coding scheme to existing naturalistic video corpora for one English-learning child whose language development is well-documented. We find that both speech directed to the child and speech overhearable by her are highly variable along the qualitative dimensions we coded, and identify the heterogeneity of overheard speech as a source of noise in previous investigations. While irrelevant as a referential cue, our results suggest caregivers' prosodic modification may play a functional role in marking speech intended for the child \u2014 especially given the significant qualitative overlap between overhead and child-directed speech along other dimensions. In spite of the frequent similarity between overheard and child-directed speech, overheard utterances were significantly less associated with child attention. Taken together, our results shed light on how adults and children co-structure the early language environment, and promise to provide similar insights when applied to naturalistic video corpora for children across the world.","tags":["child-directed speech","ethnography","referential transparency","naturalistic video","corpus analysis","child-directed language","other-directed language","overhearing"],"date":"2023-01-20T23:48:15.347255","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Language Aquisition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qu3ay\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qu3ay\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qu3ay","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qu3ay","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_332"}

Increased levels of psychological well-being (PWB) have been found to buffer this risk. Research shows that skills for improving PWB may be learned through PWB interventions; however, the dynamical mechanisms underlying this learning process are not well understood. We conducted an 8-week Randomized Control Trial (N=160; aged 18-22 years; middle- to high-SES; 77% White, 12% Asian, 6% black, 4% Latino, and 1% did not disclose their race), implemented in a mobile Health (mHealth) framework. We had three groups: an active control group (N=55); an intervention group (N=51) with positive practice intervention (PPI); and a second intervention group (N=54) with positive practice and meditation intervention. Assessments and interventions were all delivered via the participant\u2019s mobile device.  The mHealth implementation allowed as to assess the participants\u2019 PWB levels several times a day, providing rich data for understanding the dynamics of change. We used a process-oriented approach in combination with a Bayesian model (dubbed as GoHiAR) to analyze changes in PWB in terms of dynamical characteristics of the learning process. Findings suggested that the mobile assessment tool itself may have longitudinally improved college student PWB, as evidenced by instances of directional changes in dynamic characteristics (increased mean levels, decreased fluctuation, and increased regulation) of PWB measures. Moreover, although the mHealth interventions did not add benefit over mobile assessment at the group level overall, they improved PWB for students who had low baseline negative affect levels.","tags":["Bayesian analysis","ecological momentary assessment","college students","mobile health","Psychological well-being","Dynamical Systems Modeling","early adulthood","ecological momentary intervention"],"date":"2023-01-21T01:56:48.371644","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Developmental Psychology","Individual Differences","Health Psychology","Mental Health","Early Adulthood","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mb79u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mb79u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mb79u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mb79u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_333"}

However, previous research on OTRs has primarily focused on settings that are independent and identically distributed, with little attention given to the unique characteristics of educational settings, where students are nested within schools and there are hierarchical dependencies. The goal of this study is to propose a framework for designing OTRs from multisite randomized trials, a commonly used experimental design in education and psychology to evaluate educational programs. We investigate modifications to popular OTR methods, specifically Q-learning and weighting methods, in order to improve their performance in multisite randomized trials. A total of 12 modifications, 6 for Q-learning and 6 for weighting, are proposed by utilizing different multilevel models, moderators, and augmentations. Simulation studies reveal that all Q-learning modifications improve performance in multisite randomized trials and the modifications that incorporate random treatment effects show the most promise in handling cluster-level moderators. Among weighting methods, the modification that incorporates cluster dummies into moderator variables and augmentation terms performs best across simulation conditions. The proposed modifications are demonstrated through an application to estimate an OTR of conditional cash transfer programs using a multisite randomized trial in Colombia to maximize educational attainment.","tags":["Conditional cash transfer program","Multilevel data","Q-learning","Personalized learning","Clustered data","Heterogeneous treatment effects","Optimal treatment regimes","Optimal treatment rules","Weighting"],"date":"2023-01-21T12:43:51.448543","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/me5gb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/me5gb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/me5gb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/me5gb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_334"}
{"osf_id":"p5aue","title":"The observation of social interactions helps infants track agents across contexts","description":"Studies on early sociomoral cognition typically require infants to make sense of actions of two or more agents across events.

We hypothesized that when agents\u2019 actions are construed as a \u2018social interaction\u2019 rather than independent actions, agents\u2019 featural identities are more likely to be encoded and later re-identified because how agents act toward one another could convey information that is relatively stable across contexts (how agents are related or their dispositions). To this end, we compared between skeletal Giving and Taking events, building on findings showing that Giving (but not Taking) is often construed as a social interaction. In Experiment 1, 15-month-old infants (N = 48) observed either Giving or Taking between two agents, and then performed a manual search task in which one agent was switched or neither agent was switched to test infants\u2019 agent reidentification. Infants in the Giving (but not Taking) condition searched longer on switch trials compared to no-switch trials, suggesting that they reidentified both agents. In Experiment 2, 15-month-old infants (N = 24) observed the Giving events, and then performed a manual search task to test reidentification of each agent in the context of a novel partner. Infants gave no evidence of agent reidentification, suggesting that in Experiment 1 they tracked agents as a dyad.

However, limited research has considered depression risk related to meat-based and plant-based dietary patterns. This study explores the association between diet quality and depressive symptoms across omnivore, vegan, and vegetarian dietary patterns. A cross-sectional online survey utilised the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CESD-20) to measure diet quality and depressive symptoms. A total of 496 participants identified as either omnivores (n = 129), vegetarians (n = 151), or vegans (n = 216). ANOVA with Bonferonni post hoc corrections indicates that dietary quality was significantly different between groups F(2, 493) = 23.61, p &lt;.001 in omnivores and vegetarians; and omnivores and vegans. Diet quality was highest in the vegan sample, followed by vegetarian and omnivore patterns. The results show a significant, moderate negative relationship between higher diet quality and lower depressive symptoms (r = -.385, p &lt;.001) across groups. Hierarchical regression showed that diet quality accounted for 13% of the variability in depressive symptoms for the omnivore sample, 6% for vegetarians, and 8% for vegans. This study suggests that diet quality in a meat-based or plant-based diet could be a modifiable lifestyle factor with the potential to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.

The observation and rating process comprises a substantial part of these costs. In an exploratory case study, we capitalize on recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) by developing NLP-based machine learning (ML) models to investigate the possibility of automatically scoring AC exercises. First, we compared the convergent-related validity and contamination with word count of ML scores based on models that used different NLP methods to operationalize verbal behavior. Second, for the model that maximized convergence while minimizing contamination with word count (i.e., a model that used both n-grams and Universal Sentence Encoder embeddings as predictors), we investigated the criterion-related validity of its scores. Third, we examined how the interrater reliability of the AC role-play scores affects ML model convergence. To do so, we applied seven NLP methods to 96 assessees\u2019 transcriptions and trained 10 sets of ML models across 18 speeded AC role-plays to automatically score assessee performance. Results suggest that ML scores recovered most of the original variance in the overall assessment ratings, and replacing one or more human assessors with ML scores maintained criterion-related validity. Additionally, ML models seemed to exhibit higher convergence when assessors consistently detected and utilized observable behaviors to make ratings (i.e., when interrater reliability was higher). Finally, we provide a step-by-step guide for practitioners seeking to implement ML scoring in ACs.","tags":["machine learning","natural language processing","interpersonal","assessment center exercises","validation","artificial intelligence"],"date":"2023-01-21T22:16:13.944522","doi":null,"subjects":["Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Selection and Placement"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mbzdw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mbzdw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mbzdw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mbzdw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_338"}

In this review, women are broadly defined to include any individual who primarily identifies as a woman regardless of their sex assigned at birth. \nResults: The results of our analysis were consistent across the scope of the literature and indicated that women in healthcare occupations endure a significantly higher level of stress and burnout compared to their male counterparts. The following gender-specific factors were identified as having direct correlation to well-being: job satisfaction, psychological health, and work-life integration. \nConclusions: The findings from this review indicate a need for evidence-based integrative interventions across healthcare enterprises to combat stress and burnout and strengthen the resiliency and well-being of women in healthcare. Using information from this review, our team will launch a comprehensive well-being assessment and a series of interventions to support resiliency and well-being at our academic medical center.  \nKeywords: clinicians, providers, women, quality of life, stress, burnout, resiliency, wellness, job satisfaction, psychological health, work-life integration.","tags":["well-being","healthcare","women","scoping review"],"date":"2023-01-22T03:33:49.812091","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g9bwj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/g9bwj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/g9bwj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g9bwj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_339"}

This study examined individual differences in gaze behavior in two types of face-to-face social interactions: a screen-based interview and a live interview.

Extending previous studies, we distinguished between individuals\u2019 tendency to look at the face, and the tendency to look at the eyes if the face was fixated. These gaze measures demonstrated high internal consistencies (correlation between two halves of the data within a scenario) within both the screen-based and live interview scenarios. Furthermore, individuals who had a tendency to look more at the eyes during one type of interview tended to display the same behavior during the other interview type. More socially anxious participants looked less at faces in both scenarios, but no link with social anxiety was observed for the tendency to look at the eyes. This research highlights the robustness of individual variations in gaze behavior across and within interview scenarios, as well as the usefulness of measuring the tendency to look at faces separately from the tendency to look at eyes.","tags":["Individual differences","Social interaction","Social anxiety","Eye movements","Face preference"],"date":"2023-01-22T06:45:25.128460","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Physiology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8kv6j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8kv6j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8kv6j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8kv6j","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_340"}

The aim of the current study was to extend those findings using gold standard measures of anxiety and impairment, and to describe and explore the characteristics and the need for psychological support of individuals showing climate anxiety-related impairment. \nMethod: We used a cross-sectional online survey targeting adult individuals who self-identified as being worried about the climate. Participants were recruited in Sweden via social media between September and October 2022. The survey included measures of anxiety, anxiety-maintaining behaviors, impairment, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems, as well as a series of commonly used one-item questions about their climate anxiety, \nResults: A total of 1221 adults (75% women, mean age 46.3 years) provided data. Previously used one-item measures of anxiety and impairment displayed strong and significant associations with gold standard, dimensional measures of anxiety and impairment. A total of 781 (64%) individuals said that they were very worried about the climate and 153 (13%) were classified as having maladaptive climate anxiety, according to predefined criteria (i.e., a significant and persistent experience of climate anxiety and significant impairment on everyday life functioning attributable to climate anxiety). This classification of maladaptive climate anxiety was validated by a data-driven approach. Individuals with maladaptive climate anxiety were more likely to express higher levels of depressed mood and sleep problems and were also more likely to be engaged in anxiety-maintaining coping behaviors across different domains. While only a minority of respondents with maladaptive climate anxiety (25%) had been in contact with healthcare services, a majority (77%) expressed interest in receiving some form of psychological support. \nConclusions: Climate anxiety-related impairment was shown to be relatively prevalent in individuals with climate anxiety. As there is demand for psychological support, an important next step would be to develop and evaluate brief, scalable interventions targeted towards the needs of this group.","tags":["climate anxiety","climate change","environmental psychology","climate worry"],"date":"2023-01-22T09:43:22.708453","doi":null,"subjects":["Mental Health","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wmhsn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wmhsn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wmhsn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wmhsn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_341"}

{"osf_id":"6pvht","title":"Can we measure effort in cognitive tasks? Examining the application of Additive Conjoint Measurement and the Rasch model","description":"'Effort' is a concept of interest in cognitive psychology and neuroscience where many theories include it as a postulate. Despite its intuitiveness it is difficult to define such that its operationalisation follows a logical derivation chain. Recently I have proposed conceptual definitions of both actual effort, and the perception of effort, as the ratio of task demands to capacity to meet task demands, both actual and perceived respectively. Clear conceptual definitions are key for determining whether a given operationalisation meets the necessary and sufficient conditions adequately. For physical tasks valid operationalisation, and indeed measurement, of actual effort is often trivial. But a problem arises for operationalisation of actual effort in cognitive tasks where the underlying capacity that disposes an individual to be able to attempt, and perhaps complete, the task is not directly observable nor is the demand the task presents. However, a solution may lie in applications of Additive Conjoint Measurement to determine conditions where classical measurement may be possible, and the Rasch model as a measurement operation of capacity and demands to derive effort. A key aspect of the Rasch model is that it posits and estimates from data two latent constructs that I accept here as conceptually equivalent to capacity and demands respectively in my definition of effort; first a characteristic of the individual (ability), and second a characteristic of the test or item (difficulty). As such, applications of these methods might provide a measurement operation of actual effort in cognitive tasks to enable more precise formulations and testing of theories that employ the concept. In this work I explore these ideas using simulation and analogical abduction of a task where effort is known and examine an empirical dataset. Finally, I discuss the conditions under which these methods may be suitable and their inherent limitations.","tags":["Rasch","measurement","cognitive","Item Response Theory","effort"],"date":"2023-01-22T15:11:30.236867","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6pvht\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6pvht\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6pvht","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6pvht","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_343"}

In 2014, in this journal, Holbrook et al.

Marshaling extensive additional data collected in recent years, in the present paper we (a) corroborate some of the central concerns earlier raised by Holbrook et al. and (b) raise novel additional concerns about these scales, such as severe deficits in the Hubristic Pride scale\u2019s measurement precision. We conclude that the Authentic and Hubristic Pride scales are invalid for the purpose of operationalizing Tracy and Robins\u2019 two-facet model of pride.

But the real-world implementation of SWPBIS is often inadequate, which leads to lackluster outcomes. Researchers have identified amendable implementer-level factors (e.g., educators' supportive beliefs about SWPBIS) to promote the successful delivery of SWPBIS. However, it remains unknown how educators' beliefs function at the school level to influence their implementation behaviors. This school-level study piloted a school-wide Supportive Belief Intervention (SBI; an implementation strategy used before teacher training to promote supportive beliefs about SWPBIS) and examined its mechanism of change on improving implementation and student outcomes. In partnership with an urban school district, the authors delivered the SBI and SWPBIS training to 81 school teams serving a diverse student population. Baseline school-level educators' beliefs were assessed at the start of the academic year (AY; before the SBI). Posttest beliefs, intervention fidelity of Tier 1 SWPBIS, rates of student reading proficiency and suspension were assessed at the end of the AY (6 months after the SBI). Conditional process analyses with nonparametric bootstrapping (mediational and 1st stage moderated mediational models) revealed that, at the school level, (a) improved educators' supportive beliefs were associated with enhanced intervention fidelity of SWPBIS and then better corollary student outcomes (increased reading proficiency and reduced suspension rates); but (b) student socioeconomic status moderated the size of the mediation effect. Implications for research and practices about the implementation of SWPBIS and school context were discussed.","tags":["intervention fidelity","educators' beliefs","moderated mediation analysis","Tier 1 SWPBIS","school-level analysis"],"date":"2023-01-22T19:30:05.534952","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Intervention Research","School Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/p8fb3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/p8fb3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/p8fb3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/p8fb3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_345"}

This pre-registered study examined cognitive and social vulnerability factors for poor mental health in pregnancy during COVID-19. Understanding vulnerability profiles is key to identifying women at risk for deteriorating peripartum mental health. N=742 pregnant women and N=742 age and country-matched controls from the COVID-19 Risks Across the Lifespan Study were included. Using a case-match control design allowed us to explore whether the cognitive vulnerability profiles would differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The findings showed that COVID-19-related stress was associated with heightened levels of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Its impact was greatest in women with cognitive (i.e., higher intolerance of uncertainty and tendency to worry) and social (i.e., higher level of self-reported loneliness) vulnerabilities. Importantly, our data show that the mental health impacts of the pandemic were greater in pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant, especially those with cognitive and social vulnerabilities. The results highlight the urgent need to prioritise mental health care for pregnant women to mitigate the impact of COVID-19-related stress on women\u2019s postpartum mental health and their infants\u2019 well-being.","tags":["Postpartum depression","Pregnancy","pandemic","social support","loneliness","worry","intolerance of uncertainty","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-01-22T23:37:55.524134","doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2023.01.053","subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Depressive Disorders","Psychiatry","Anxiety Disorders","Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/t8hdr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/t8hdr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/t8hdr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/t8hdr","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jad.2023.01.053","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_346"}

A Meta-Analysis [Pre-Print]","description":"Inequity aversion, a negative response to receiving less (or more) than others, is a key building block of the human sense of fairness. While some theorize that inequity aversion is widespread across the animal kingdom (shared by species as diverse as crows, mice, dogs, chimpanzees and humans), others believe that it is an exclusively human evolutionary adaptation to the selective pressures of cooperation among nonkin. Essential to this theoretical debate is the empirical question of whether nonhuman animals are averse toward unequal distributions of resources. Over the past two decades, researchers have reported that species across a wide range of taxa object to unequal treatment. These results, however, have been questioned on both conceptual and empirical grounds. In the largest empirical investigation of inequity aversion in nonhuman animals conducted to date, we synthesize the data from 23 papers, covering 60,430 observations of 18 species. We find no evidence for inequity aversion in nonhuman animals. Alternative interpretations of the data and implications for the evolution of fairness are discussed.","tags":["animal_behavior","fairness","evolution","inequity_aversion"],"date":"2023-01-23T01:47:38.666409","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Animal Learning and Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/86vkf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/86vkf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/86vkf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/86vkf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_347"}

This is particularly true in romantic relationships, where a person\u2019s EI may play an important role in their partner\u2019s emotional experiences. The current study (N = 407 romantic dyads) uses actor-partner interdependence models to examine the associations between EI (ability and self-rated) and wellbeing (psychological wellbeing, life satisfaction, affect).

It is increasingly being used in individual differences research to examine brain-behaviour associations. Prior work has demonstrated low test-retest stability of functional MRI measures, highlighting the need to examine the longitudinal stability (test-retest reliability across long timespans) of MRI measures across brain regions and imaging metrics, particularly in adolescence. In this study, we examined the longitudinal stability of grey matter measures (cortical thickness, surface area, and volume) across brain regions, and testing sites in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release v4.0. Longitudinal stability ICC estimates ranged from 0 to .98, depending on the measure, parcellation, and brain region. We used Intra-Class Effect Decomposition (ICED) to estimate between-subjects variance and error variance, and assess the relative contribution of each across brain regions and testing sites on longitudinal stability. In further exploratory analyses we examined the influence of parcellation used (Desikan-Killiany-Tourville and Destrieux) on longitudinal stability. Our results highlight meaningful heterogeneity in longitudinal stability across brain regions, structural measures (cortical thickness in particular), parcellations, and ABCD testing sites. Differences in longitudinal stability across brain regions were largely driven by between-subjects variance, whereas differences in longitudinal stability across testing sites was largely driven by differences in error variance. We argue that investigations such as this are essential to capture patterns of longitudinal stability heterogeneity that would otherwise go undiagnosed. Such improved understanding allows the field to more accurately interpret results, compare effect sizes, and plan more powerful studies.","tags":["brain imaging","longitudinal","longitudinal stability","adolescence","reliability"],"date":"2023-01-23T08:15:43.110048","doi":null,"subjects":["Neuroscience","Quantitative Methods","Psychometrics","Developmental Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zpu6t\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zpu6t\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zpu6t","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zpu6t","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_349"}

Interestingly, the grade provided by the system, and especially the difference between the student's self-estimated grade and the system grade, showed a large influence.

We tested children from Switzerland (N = 38) and Brazil (N = 41), who were exposed to facial masks to different extents during the Covid-19 pandemic. In Brazil, the more strict mask mandate resulted in longer mask exposure. Children were asked to point to the face displaying a certain emotion (happy, angry, or sad) from a selection of four faces displaying different emotions. Depending on the condition, actors either wore no cover, a facial mask, or sunglasses. Results showed that children recognized emotions in the no cover and sunglasses condition better than in the mask condition. For the Brazilian children, this was the case for all emotions, whereas, for the Swiss children, only for happiness and sadness. Yet regardless of the country, the more hours per week children were exposed to masks, the better they recognized emotions in general, including in uncovered faces. These findings suggest that a facial mask covering a face negatively impacts children\u2019s emotion recognition in that specific face. However, with prolonged exposure to masks, children appear to adapt to and compensate for the lack of facial cues from the nose and mouth, especially for happiness. Hence, masks may impair kindergarten children\u2019s emotion recognition in the short run but may benefit their broader reading of facial emotional cues in the long run.","tags":["faical masks","sunglasses","Covid-19","emotion recognition","kindergarten children","cross-countries comparison"],"date":"2023-01-23T10:28:04.132997","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development","Emotional Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Early Childhood"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/y4afm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/y4afm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/y4afm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/y4afm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_352"}

{"osf_id":"4j96u","title":"73% of the observed bilingual (dis)advantageous effects on cognition stem from sociolinguistic factors: A systematic review","description":"Being bilingual confers certain behavioral adaptations. The two ongoing discussions that surround their occurrence concern the type of the effect and its origin. The former can be analyzed in terms of three outcomes: positive, negative, and null. The status of the latter is less clear. While many studies recognize some interaction of cognitive factors with social factors such as socio-economic status and sociolinguistic prestige, these observations are often made in passing and lack critical detail. Consequently, it has not been yet determined what degree of the reported bilingualism-related behavioral adaptations derive primarily from sociolinguistic factors. This systematic PRISMA-based review addresses this question. Analyzing the results of 368 studies, we find that 73.41% of the 267 studies that report bilingual adaptations attribute them either to sociolinguistic factors alone or to the interaction of sociolinguistic factors with cognitive factors. Linking the two debates, type of effect and origin of effect, this systematic review finds a previously unreported correlation: Studies that find evidence for bilingual disadvantages are more likely to claim a sociolinguistic origin, while studies that report bilingual advantages are more likely to link their findings to a cognitive origin. We discuss these results and present the key components of a sociolinguistic theory of the origin of bilingual effects.","tags":["Bilingualism","Sociolinguistic prestige","Socio-economic status","Cognitive adaptations"],"date":"2023-01-23T11:30:29.190763","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4j96u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4j96u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4j96u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4j96u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_354"}

Consequently, under the Data Rate Theorem, they must be constantly controlled by embedding regulators. For example, blood pressure and the stream of consciousness require\npersistent delicate regulation in higher organisms. Here, using the Rate Distortion Theorem of information theory, we derive a form of the Data Rate Theorem of control theory that characterizes such instability for adiabatically stationary nonergodic systems and uncover novel forms of cognitive dynamics under stochastic challenge. These range from aperiodic stochastic amplification to Yerkes-Dodson signal transduction and outright system collapse. The analysis, deliberately closely adapted from recent purely biological studies, leads toward new statistical tools for data analysis, uncovering groupoid\nsymmetry-breaking phase transition analogs to Fisher Zeros in physical systems that may be important for studies of machine intelligence under real-world, hence embodied, interaction.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-23T15:45:07.659382","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7d8zj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7d8zj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7d8zj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7d8zj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_356"}

Previous creativity research has suggested that semantic memory, attentional focus or inhibitory control might be engaged when performing creativity tasks. In the present study, we tested whether stronger global attention, larger semantic priming and better ability to inhibit interfering information were related to performance in a creativity task such as the Remote Associate test (RAT). With this aim, 124 participants performed a lexical decision task in which the degree of semantic association (strong and weak) was manipulated. They also performed Navon\u2019s global-local task, in which global precedence and global\/local interference indexes were calculated, and an adapted selective retrieval procedure from which an inhibition index was obtained. The results indicated that better creative performance was predicted by larger semantic priming between strong associates and by larger inhibitory effects, while attentional style was not associated with performance in the RAT.

We show that principals make useful and pragmatic first moves and helpers accumulate evidence over time before initiating a helpful move.

In addition, in the case of autistic individuals with language impairment, investigators often approach caregivers to discuss research participation, rather than autistic individuals themselves. This gap limits the ecological validity of language research in autism. To address this gap, this clinical focus article describes strategies for engaging REM autistic young adults with language impairment using lessons learned from five years of longitudinal research with this population. This approach involved an ongoing community partnership, as well as participatory partnerships with REM autistic individuals and community stakeholders, developed through \u201cslow science.\u201d\nConclusion: The approach yielded excellent retention of participants over five years and led to co-development of research projects aimed at priorities described by REM autistic individuals and their families, including understanding self-determination, social determinants of health, and language variability in autistic REM with language impairment.

However, the distinction between active and passive use of social media, although important in explaining a variety of users\u2019 behaviors, has been overlooked in terms of its potential to predict key outcomes like beliefs in conspiracy theories. In three studies (N = 1388, in total), we provide evidence on (a) the role of passive social media use in believing in conspiracy theories via personal relative deprivation; (b) the interaction effect between social media use and personal relative deprivation on beliefs in conspiracy theories. Results showed that passive social media use is linked to, and has a positive effect on, beliefs in conspiracy theories and this relationship is explained via increased personal relative deprivation. Additionally, this main effect was qualified by an interaction with increased personal relative deprivation. Results are discussed in light of their social and media psychological contribution and implications in the digital era, an era of fighting, out of many, against misinformation.","tags":["relative deprivation","conspiracy beliefs","passive social media use","social media","emotions","active social media use"],"date":"2023-01-23T16:39:13.916104","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Individual Differences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/59t2z\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/59t2z\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/59t2z","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/59t2z","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_362"}
{"osf_id":"ve4rg","title":"Using recurrent neural network to estimate irreducible stochasticity in human choice-behavior","description":"Theoretical computational models are widely used to describe latent cognitive processes. However, these models do not equally explain data across participants, with some individuals showing a bigger predictive gap than others. In the current study, we examined the use of theory-independent models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNN), to classify the source of a predictive gap in the observed data of a single individual. This approach aims to identify whether the low predictability of behavioral data is mainly due to noisy decision-making or miss-specification of the theoretical model. First, we used computer simulation in the context of reinforcement learning to demonstrate that RNNs can be used to identify model miss-specification in simulated agents with varying degrees of behavioral noise. Specifically, both prediction performance and the number of RNN training epochs (i.e., the point of early stopping) can be used to estimate the amount of stochasticity in the data. Second, we applied our approach to an empirical dataset where the actions of low IQ participants, compared with high IQ participants, showed lower predictability by a well-known theoretical model (i.e., Daw's hybrid model for the two-step task). Both the predictive gap and the point of early stopping of the RNN suggested that model miss-specification is similar across individuals. This led us to a provisional conclusion that low IQ subjects are mostly noisier compared to their high IQ peers, rather than being more miss-specified by the theoretical model. We discuss the implications and limitations of this approach, considering the growing literature in both theoretical and data-driven computational modeling in decision-making science.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-23T17:36:29.640227","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Neuroscience","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ve4rg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ve4rg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ve4rg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ve4rg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_363"}

{"osf_id":"quhns","title":"When it pays to be quick: dissociating control over task preparation and speed-accuracy trade-off in task switching","description":"Task switching paradigms offer an experimental window into the dynamics of cognitive flexibility. A key finding is that when switching from one task to another, participants exhibit a degradation in performance, even when given ample time to prepare for the switch. One hypothesis is that this \u201cresidual switch cost\u201d stems from structural constraints on the cognitive system. However, an alternative hypothesis, which fits well with modern views on the costs of cognitive control, suggests the residual switch cost has a strategic origin. That is, timely preparation for a task switch incurs effort and\/or opportunity costs, thus participants might choose not to do so, at least on some proportion of trials, unless adequately compensated. To demonstrate effort-sensitive, strategic control over task preparation, studies have aimed to offset the cost of preparation by offering monetary reward for responding by a deadline and observed reduced switch costs. However, rather than promoting timely preparation, such response deadlines might instead encourage speed-accuracy trade-offs following task preparation. A review of existing experiments involving reward and deadlines provides inconclusive results about how these factors influenced task switching performance. We therefore conducted a new experiment to provide a more sensitive test of the different hypotheses. Our data support a model in which response deadline for earning monetary reward affects speed-accuracy trade-off, while the preparatory process is unaffected. Accordingly, we argue that a reduction in switch cost due to reward-associated response deadlines does not necessarily provide evidence for strategic adjustment of task preparation. More generally, our approach demonstrates the utility of detailed modeling in conjunction with empirical testing in evaluating hypotheses concerning the dynamics of cognitive flexibility.","tags":["cognitive modeling","failure to engage","dynamical systems","task switching","residual switch cost"],"date":"2023-01-23T18:22:43.524123","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/quhns\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/quhns\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/quhns","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/quhns","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_366"}

We then conducted factor and item level analysis using responses on the PTSD Checklist \u2013 specific type collected from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study data. Factor analysis showed invariance at the strict factorial level. Differential item functioning (DIF) was found in four items: anhedonia, emotionally numbing, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping.

{"osf_id":"n8gzv","title":"The Dual-Perspective Model\u2019s \u201cPrimacy of Communion\u201d Hypothesis:  A Vignette Experiment Using LIWC-22 and Further Theoretical Exploration","description":"Results of a vignette experiment supporting the \u201cprimacy of communion over agency\u201d hypothesis implied by \u201cthe dual-perspective model\u201d (Abele and Wojciszke, 2014) are reported here.  However, while the results partially support this model, they do not fit it completely and they prompt a wider exploration of some additional theoretical questions concerning the context, process, and outcomes of the communion-agency dynamic. The present study uses the latest Linguistic Inquiry Word Count tool (LIWC-22) to analyze the implicit motive to affiliate observed in written transcripts collected as part of an earlier study (Stolte, 2021a). The broad goal of the work reported here is to extend our grasp of the agency-communion dynamic as it operates across a wide array of social behavior and social situations.  Below, we (a) discuss the central logic of the \u201cdual-perspective model\u201d (DPM), (b) report data partially supporting the \u201cprimacy of communion\u201d hypothesis, then (c) expand the analysis by examining  three theoretical issue areas focused on: (i)  the broader socio-cultural context,  (ii)  the interactive process of social framing, and  (iii) the existential need for social grappling. We argue that while communion does, under certain conditions, have primacy over agency as DPM asserts, other conditions are likely to lead to the primacy of agency over communion.  Such other conditions need to be more fully explored and specified as theoretical scope conditions.","tags":["Dual-Perspective Model","Social Exchange","Power-Dependence","Social Framing","Socio-cultural Context","Social Grappling","Agency vs. Communion","Symbolic Interaction"],"date":"2023-01-23T20:35:04.963137","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Interpersonal Relationships"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n8gzv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/n8gzv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/n8gzv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n8gzv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_369"}

We assessed eight SEB skills at the onset of a volunteering program, and students\u2019 volunteer hours were assessed 10-weeks later. Approximately 41.5% of the sample did not complete any volunteer hours. Higher levels of perspective taking skill, abstract thinking skill, and stress regulation were associated with more time spent volunteering.

Reflexive thematic analysis revealed three broad themes inclusive of social, personal life and structural factors. Psychologists described currently employing a range of self-care techniques to protect against burnout, and noted professional supervision and collegial bonds as protective factors. Systemic issues such as overwork, high demand and poor workplace experiences were negatively impacting their professional wellbeing, many of which compounded, such as higher demand leading to longer waitlists, and then to higher severity and even longer waitlists. Implications for both psychologists and employers are discussed.","tags":["psychologists","New Zealand psychologists","resilience","professional quality of life","New Zealand"],"date":"2023-01-24T00:36:41.759803","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ungwh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ungwh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ungwh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ungwh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_373"}
{"osf_id":"vz69e","title":"Selective attention and stimulus integration have distinct influences on the temporal dynamics of perceptual decision-making","description":"Responding appropriately to incoming sensory information is crucial for adaptive behaviour. In most real-world contexts, multiple sources of information are simultaneously available, and must be prioritised or combined in the service of adaptive decisions. Here we implemented a decision-making paradigm with the goal of characterizing the computational dynamics of perceptual decisions requiring either selection or integration of distinct sensory information. In late 2019, participants viewed displays in which a single patch of moving dots was presented in isolation (baseline), or where two patches overlapped at the same spatial location. In the overlapping displays, participants were cued to judge the direction of just one of the two dot-patches (selection) or the average direction of both patches (integration). In all tasks participants made speeded judgements indicating whether the task-relevant motion was toward the left or right of vertical, and the angular offset of the task-relevant motion was varied across trials. Relative to the baseline task, non-decision times were longer in the selection and integration tasks, suggesting they may require prolonged or supplementary processing stages. Drift rates were lower, suggesting a reduced signal-to-noise ratio, in tasks involving selection and integration. Our findings highlight the temporal dynamics of perceptual decision-making with multiple concurrent stimuli.","tags":["computational modelling","drift diffusion model","attentional selection","perceptual decision-making","integration"],"date":"2023-01-24T02:49:28.466339","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vz69e\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vz69e\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vz69e","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vz69e","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_374"}
{"osf_id":"234k8","title":"Braking behaviour of automated vehicles as critical implicit communication for pedestrians\u2019 vehicle behaviour estimation and road crossing","description":"The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) has generated high societal expectations. However, due to the absence of the driver role, the communication issues between pedestrians and AVs have not yet been solved. Previous research has shown the crucial role of implicit signals in this context. However, it is still unclear how pedestrians subjectively estimate vehicle behaviour and if pedestrians incorporate these estimations as part of their crossing decisions. For the first time, this study explored the impact of implicit signals both on pedestrians' subjective estimations of approaching vehicle behaviour across a wide range of experimental traffic scenarios and on their crossing behaviour in the same scenarios through a comprehensive analysis.  Two simulator tasks, i.e., a natural road crossing task and a vehicle behaviour estimation task, were designed with time to collision, vehicle speed, and braking behaviour controlled. A novel finding is that the correlation between crossing decisions and vehicle behaviour estimations depends on the traffic scenario. That is, pedestrians could recognise the vehicle's different braking behaviours and that their crossing decisions aligned well with their subjective estimates, supporting the idea that pedestrians actively estimate vehicle behaviour as part of their decision-making process. However, if the traffic gap is big enough, there is a separation between crossing decisions and estimations about vehicle behaviour. We further showed that pedestrians crossed the street earlier and estimated yielding behaviour more accurately in early-onset braking scenarios than in late-onset braking scenarios. Interestingly, vehicle speed significantly affected pedestrian behaviour and estimations, with pedestrians tending to perceive low vehicle speed as yielding behaviour regardless of whether the vehicle yielded. Finally, we showed that visual cue $\\dot{\\tau}$ is associated with detecting vehicle-yielding behaviour. Our findings reveal in detail the impacts of implicit signals on pedestrian crossing decisions and have implications for road crossing safety and the development of AVs.","tags":["Visual cues","Implicit communication","Pedestrian-automated vehicle interaction","Road crossing","Vehicle behaviour estimation"],"date":"2023-01-24T03:21:09.303645","doi":null,"subjects":["Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/234k8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/234k8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/234k8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/234k8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_375"}
{"osf_id":"h8msp","title":"Recognition memory decisions made with short- and long-term retrieval","description":"The present research explores the way retrieval from both short- and long-term memory is used to make recognition decisions about the contents of short-term memory. Pictures are presented in a short list followed by a test picture, either a target or foil. The research contrasts four paradigms: VM: target and foil responses to a given stimulus change from trial to trial; CM: the responses do not change from trial to trial; AN: every trial uses new stimuli; MIXED: combinations of VM, CN, and AN occur on each trial. These conditions vary the way long-term memory (traces from prior trials) affect current trial recognition decisions. A new paradigm is used in which a given picture is equally often presented and tested in both VM and CM. A model is presented that shows the way short- and long-term retrieval work together to produce the observed accuracy and response time performance. The model is used to predict published data from a traditional paradigm (Nosofsky et al., 2021) and the new data. It predicts quite well the accuracy and response time results from 376 conditions, while holding almost all parameter values constant across groups and conditions, lending support to its assumed processes.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-24T06:20:03.811591","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h8msp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h8msp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h8msp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h8msp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_376"}

We present a formalized version of the insufficient adjustment model, which captures the idea that decreasing the time that people have to adjust from anchors draws their estimates closer to the anchors. In four independent studies (N = 898), we could not confirm this effect of time on anchoring. Moreover, anchoring effects vanished in the two studies that deviated from classical paradigms by using a visual scale or a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm to allow faster responses. Although we propose that the current version of the insufficient adjustment model should be discarded, we believe that adjustment models hold the most potential for the future of anchoring research, and we make suggestions for what these might look like.","tags":["boomerang","assimilation","Tversky","Epley","insufficient adjustment","TOTE","Kahneman","two-alternative force-choice","contrast","process model","2AFC","formal model","test operate test exit","repulsion","Gilovich","anchoring","time pressure"],"date":"2023-01-24T08:56:20.910831","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Consumer Decision Making","Judgment and Decision Making","Consumer Psychology","Impression Formation","Cognitive Psychology","Nudges","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","School Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Negotiation","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jztk2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jztk2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jztk2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jztk2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_377"}
{"osf_id":"xyrdt","title":"The importance of face-shape masculinity for perceptions of male dominance depends on study design","description":"Dominance perceptions play an important role in social interactions. Although many researchers have proposed that shape masculinity is an important facial cue for dominance perceptions, evidence for this claim has come almost exclusively from studies that assessed perceptions of experimentally manipulated face images using forced-choice paradigms. Consequently, we investigated the role of masculine shape characteristics in perceptions of men\u2019s facial dominance (1) using the forced-choice method and (2) when unmanipulated face images were rated for dominance and shape masculinity was measured from face images. Although we observed large positive effects of masculinity on dominance perceptions when we used the forced-choice method (Cohen\u2019s ds = 2.51 and 3.28), the effect of masculinity on dominance perceptions was considerably smaller when unmanipulated face images were rated and shape masculinity measured from face images (Cohen\u2019s ds = 0.44 and 0.62). This same pattern was observed when faces were rated separately for physical and social dominance and was seen for two different sets of stimuli. Collectively, these results suggest that previous research using the forced-choice method overstated the importance of face-shape masculinity for dominance perceptions and that shape masculinity is less important for dominance assessments of unmanipulated face images than previous research suggested.

The concept is now so mainstream that it is often used in a potentially reductionist, stigmatizing or otherwise harmful manner. In this paper we explore and discuss our positions on the use of control-related terminology for EDs. In particular we argue that although control can play a role in some EDs, an overemphasis upon this factor is not beneficial. It is important to challenge a discourse that can lead to EDs being perceived as something \u2018wrong\u2019 with the individual, rather than a consequence of life events or other environmental influences. The authors of this auto-ethnographic position paper include academic researchers, individuals with lived experience and clinicians (not mutually exclusive). In sharing our experiences and observations, we hope to raise awareness of the wider impacts that control framing can have on ED perceptions, treatment, recovery and individuals\u2019 lived experience.

We therefore sought to understand the cognitive appraisals that mediate the relationship between pressurised performance situations and the onset of anxiety. We tested the effects of performance pressure and error feedback on appraisals of the probability and cost of failure, the experience of anxiety, and subsequent impacts on visual attention, movement kinematics, and task performance during a virtual reality interception task. A series of linear mixed effects models indicated that failure feedback and situational pressure influenced moment-to-moment appraisals of the probability and cost of failure, which subsequently predicted the onset of anxious states. We did not, however, observe downstream effects on performance and attention. The findings support the predictions of Attentional Control Theory Sport, that i) momentary errors lead to negative appraisals of the probability of future failure; and ii) that appraisals of both the cost and probability of future failure are important predictors of anxiety. The results contribute to a better understanding of the precursors to anxiety and the feedback loops that may maintain anxious states.","tags":["choking","appraisal","clutch","attention","sport"],"date":"2023-01-24T11:59:36.846259","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/w4m3x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/w4m3x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/w4m3x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/w4m3x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_380"}

However, avoidance becomes pathological when it is executed out of proportion of threat (i.e., excessive or insufficient avoidance), persists in the absence of threat, or excessively generalize to other innocuous situations. Although there has been an increase in research in these different processes of pathological avoidance, the role of inter-individual differences in these avoidance processes receives less research attention, despite of its theoretical and clinical importance. In this systematic review, we summarized the role of inter-individual traits that related to risk or resilient factors for anxiety-related disorders, trauma-and stressor-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive related disorders, pain related disorders, eating-related disorders, and affective disorders. A majority of the inter-individual differences had an apparent mixed or null effect on the different processes of avoidance. We discussed this lack of evidence of inter-individual differences on avoidance due to a lack of methodological and\/or analytical consensus in the field, in addition to a lack of integration of recent findings into existing theories. Recommendations for future research are discussed, with a focus on examining the conditions or experimental parameters for certain inter-individual traits to manifest their effects on avoidance, identifying the nuances of inter-individual differences in avoidance, and a call for integrating recent preliminary findings into existing theories.","tags":["conditioning","avoidance","personality","inter-individual differences","psychopathology"],"date":"2023-01-24T13:06:00.477833","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Animal Learning and Behavior","Emotion","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2xbwd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2xbwd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2xbwd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2xbwd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_382"}
{"osf_id":"4xsvf","title":"The Effect of Legal Consciousness of the Korean Unification Law on South Koreans\u2019 Attitudes Towards Unification and Preferences on Policies Towards North Korea","description":"The Republic of Korea enacted and promulgated the Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act on August 1, 1990 to specifically execute the Special Presidential Declaration for National Pride and Unification Prosperity, expressing its willingness to promote North Korea and unification policies based on the rule of law. As a result, the Ministry of Unification currently holds 31 laws, Presidential decrees, and Ministry of Unification decrees. However, the public's understanding of the Unification Law is insufficient, even though interest in North Korea and inter-Korean relations is high, due to the fact that the North Korea policy has been led by the president and the administration so far and the National Assembly, a legislative body, has been very lowly responsible for inter-Korean relations. Effective rule of law reduces corruption, protects people from injustice, while recognizing responsible government and fundamental rights, and lays the foundation for a community of justice, opportunity, and peace. In order to become an ideal unified state, a legal system must be secured to create a fair society according to reasonable and public rules through \"rule of law,\" not arbitrarily by the ruler. The present study examined the legal consciousness of unification-related laws among 240 South Korean citizens over the age of 19 using an online questionnaire. Results show that legal consciousness of Unification Laws has an impact on attitudes towards unification and preferences for Inter-Korean policy. This suggests that the government could consider expanding the functionality of the Database on a Unified Korea\u2019s Legal System and strengthening legal education in the curriculum of the National Institute for Unification Education.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-24T13:09:59.632126","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4xsvf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4xsvf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4xsvf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4xsvf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_383"}

As new online environments have developed during the 21st Century, previous studies have correlated specific social media platforms with personality traits; yet, few studies have investigated whether the relationships between traits and social media use are similar for different social media environments.  This paper comprises two studies.  First, we explore the relationships between personality traits and reported frequency of use for different social media platforms (Study 1).  We find subtle differences between the platforms that relate to extraversion and those that relate to neuroticism; for example, a relationship is found between Facebook and extraversion, but not neuroticism.  We then assess this finding through a field study comparing the personality profiles of Instagram users and Facebook users (Study 2).  Our findings suggest that Instagram and Facebook do actually attract users with similar trait profiles.  These preliminary findings could fuel future research seeking to understand how personality relates to patterns of social media use and behaviour in different online environments.","tags":["Facebook","Personality","Instagram","Big Five"],"date":"2023-01-24T14:00:15.124334","doi":null,"subjects":["Personality and Situations","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Consumer Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h7mkb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h7mkb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h7mkb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h7mkb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_385"}

Although metacognition is vital for creative performance, relevant work is sparse, which may be partly due to persistent ambiguities in the theoretical conceptualization of creative metacognition. Therefore, this article proposes a systematic framework of creative metacognition (CMC), which builds on recent advancements in metacognition theory and extends them to meet the specifics of creative cognition. The CMC framework consists of two dynamic components\u2014monitoring and control\u2014and a static component of metacognitive knowledge, each subsuming metacognitive processes applying to the level of task, performance, and responses. We describe the presumed function of these metacognitive components in the creative process, present evidence in support of each, and discuss their association with related constructs, such as creative self-beliefs. We further highlight the dynamic interplay of metacognitive processes across task performance and identify promising avenues for future research.","tags":["knowledge","metacognition","monitoring","creativity","control"],"date":"2023-01-24T14:41:53.124587","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Creativity"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s793q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s793q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s793q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s793q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_386"}

Yet, the supporting literature for such \u2018psychographic\u2019 messaging is relatively limited.

Based on separate earlier evidence suggesting the appeal of specific messaging, imagery, and colours, this preliminary paper explores the effectiveness of targeting extraverts in particular by altering the aesthetics of social media content.  We undertake two initial studies indicating that, when offered the choice of two social media adverts, extraverts do not prefer an advert featuring aesthetic cues intended to appeal to them.  Second, across both Facebook and Instagram, adverts designed to display aesthetic cues that relate to extraversion, fail to appeal to extraverts.

We tested whether poorer representational fidelity across perception, short-term and long-term memory (STM\/LTM) are among the earliest signs of cognitive ageing. Our paradigm probed target-lure object mnemonic discrimination and precision of object-location binding. In a lifespan sample, cognitive deficits were observed in midlife when complex, detailed stimulus representations were required for perceptual and short\/long-term Forced Choice mnemonic discrimination. A continuous metric of object-location source memory combined with computational modelling demonstrated that errors in short- and long-term memory in middle-aged adults were largely driven by a loss of precision for retrieved memories, not necessarily by forgetting. On a trial-by-trial basis, the fidelity of item and spatial information was more tightly bound in long- as opposed to short-term memory with this association being unaffected by ageing. Standard neuropsychological tests without demands on memory quality were less sensitive to age effects than memory precision. Perceptual discrimination predicted mnemonic discrimination across tasks. Neuropsychological proxies for prefrontal executive functions correlated with short-term, but not long-term, memory fidelity. Conversely, neuropsychological indicators of hippocampal integrity correlated with mnemonic discrimination and precision of both STM and LTM, suggesting partially dissociable mechanisms of inter-individual variability in short- and long-term memory fidelity.","tags":["perception","aging","behavioural modelling","memory precision","long-term memory","memory fidelity","short-term memory"],"date":"2023-01-24T16:08:27.561745","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x6td4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x6td4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x6td4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x6td4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_389"}

Participants completed a questionnaire package including technology adoption, knowledge and preference of vehicle automation questions, and the Basic Personality Traits Inventory (BPTI). A series of ANOVA and mediation analyses were conducted to test proposed relations. High technology adoption was associated with preferring higher levels of automation. Drivers from Turkey and drivers with previous knowledge of high or full automation preferred higher levels of automation in the two countries. High extraversion and openness to change were associated with high technology adoption, leading to preferring vehicles with higher levels of automation. All in all, the results indicated that drivers\u2019 knowledge of the automated vehicle systems and general traits, such as personality and technology adoption, have a role in vehicle preference.

The purpose of these studies was to test if newly learned associations between face and scene category images lead observers to use scene information as a proxy for the face target. Our results found that scene information was used as a proxy for the target to guide attention but only when the target face was difficult to discriminate from the distractor face; when the faces were easy to distinguish, attention was no longer guided by the scene proxy. The results suggest that attention is flexibly guided by both target features as well as features of objects that are predictive of the target location. The degree to which each contributes to guiding attention depends on the efficiency with which that information can be used to decode the location of the target. The results contribute to the view that attentional guidance is highly flexible in its use of information to rapidly locate the target.","tags":["Visual search","Attentional guidance","Proxy","Target template"],"date":"2023-01-24T20:21:05.063796","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/y26qx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/y26qx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/y26qx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/y26qx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_394"}

However, little research has examined this in early adolescence and even fewer studies exist in large diverse racial\/ethnic populations. Data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study at age 11-12 (Mage=11.55; range 10-14) and age 12-13 (Mage=12.42; range 11-14) were used to examine a cross-time cross-lagged model in which polygenic scores for risky behavior were considered predictors of individual rule breaking, peer rule breaking, and alcohol sips. This was examined separately in European American (n=5113; 47% female), African American (n=1159; 50% female), and Hispanic (n=1624; 48% female) subgroups accounting for age, gender, site, income, and genetic principal components. In European Americans, polygenic scores were associated with individual and peer rule breaking at both ages. Individual and peer rule breaking were associated with one another within and across time. In African American and Hispanic subgroups, polygenic scores were associated with individual rule breaking at age 11-12. Individual and peer rule breaking were associated at age 11-12 in both subgroups and age 12-13 in the Hispanic subgroup. In all subgroups, peer rule breaking at 12-13 was associated with alcohol sips at 12-13. Results indicate that individual and peer rule breaking can influence one another within and across time with rGE likely implicated in European Americans. As a result, peer rule breaking can contribute to alcohol sips in early adolescence.","tags":["Polygenic","Adolescence","Peer","Rule Breaking","Alcohol","ABCD"],"date":"2023-01-24T20:48:52.409018","doi":null,"subjects":["Adolescence","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3rm7f\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3rm7f\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3rm7f","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3rm7f","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_395"}
{"osf_id":"zbfp3","title":"Different electrophysiological signatures of similarity-induced and Stroop-like interference in language production","description":"Contextual similarity between targets and competitors, whether semantic or phonological, often leads to behavioral interference in language production. It has been assumed that resolving such interference relies on control processes similar to those involved in tasks such as Stroop. This paper tests this assumption by comparing the electrophysiological signatures of interference resulting from a contextual similarity vs. a Stroop-like manipulation. In blocks containing two items, participants repeatedly named pictures that were semantically related, phonologically related or unrelated (contextual similarity manipulation). In straight blocks, the pictures were named by their canonical names. In reverse blocks, participants had to reverse the names (Stroop-like manipulation). Both manipulations led to behavioral interference, but with different electrophysiological profiles. Whole-scalp stimulus-locked and response-locked analyses of semantic and phonological similarity pointed to a system with global modularity with some degree of cascading and interactivity, whereas the effect of phase reversal was sustained and of the opposite polarity. More strikingly, a representational similarity analysis showed a biphasic pattern for Stroop-like reversal, with earlier higher similarity scores for the reverse phase flipping into lower scores ~500 ms post-stimulus onset. In contrast, contextual similarity induced higher similarity scores up to articulation. Finally, response-locked mediofrontal components indexing performance monitoring differed between manipulations. Correct response negativity\u2019s (CRN) amplitude was lower in the phonological blocks, whereas a pre-CRN component had higher amplitude in reverse vs. straight blocks. These results argue against the involvement of Stroop-like control mechanisms in resolving interference from contextual similarity in language production.","tags":["semantic interference","ERN\/CRN","conflict monitoring","phonological interference","inhibitory control","language production","EEG"],"date":"2023-01-24T22:02:19.510742","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":null,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zbfp3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zbfp3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zbfp3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zbfp3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_396"}

Using a Graeco-Latin Square design, we randomly assigned twenty-six participants into four groups. This counterbalanced the within-participant factor of practice condition (AO+MI, AO, MI, Control) across four cup-stacking tasks, which varied in their complexity. On each of the three consecutive practice days participants experienced twenty trials under each of the three mental practice conditions. On each trial, a first-person perspective video depicted bilateral cup-stacking performed by an experienced model. During AO, participants passively observed this action, responding only to occasional colour cues. For AO+MI, participants imagined performing the observed action and synchronised their concurrent MI with the display. For MI, a sequence of pictures cued imagery of each stage of the task. Analyses revealed a significant main effect of practice condition both at the \u2019surprise\u2019 post-test (Day 3) and at the one-week retention test. At both time points movement execution times were significantly shorter for AO+MI compared with AO, MI and the Control. Execution times were also shorter overall at the retention compared with the post-test. These results demonstrate that a complex novel motor task can be acquired without physical training. Practitioners can therefore use AO+MI practice to supplement physical practice and optimise skill learning.","tags":["motor imagery practice","mental practice","motor learning","imitation learning","motor skill acquisition","combined action observation and motor imagery (AO+MI) training"],"date":"2023-01-24T22:10:12.695290","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Imagery","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/w6x54\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/w6x54\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/w6x54","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/w6x54","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_397"}

While studies have shown that demographic variables influence caregiver ratings of behavior problems, the extent to which the CBCL\/1.5-5 functions equivalently at the item level across diverse samples is unknown.\n\nMethods\nItem-level data of CBCL\/1.5-5 from a large sample of young children (N = 9087) were drawn from 26 cohorts in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes program. Factor analyses and the alignment method were applied to examine measurement invariance (MI) and differential item functioning (DIF) across child (age, sex, bilingual status, and neurodevelopmental disorders), and caregiver (sex, education level, household income level, depression, and language version administered) characteristics. Child race was examined in sensitivity analyses.\n\nResults\nItems with the most impactful DIF across child and caregiver groupings were identified for Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. The robust item sets, excluding the high DIF items, showed good reliability and high correlation with the original Internalizing and Total Problems scales, with lower reliability for Externalizing. Language version of CBCL administration, education level and sex of the caregiver respondent showed the most significant impact on MI, followed by child age. Sensitivity analyses revealed that child race has a unique impact on DIF over and above socioeconomic status.\n\nConclusions\nThe CBCL\/1.5-5, a caregiver-report measure of early childhood behavior problems, showed bias across demographic groups. Robust item sets with less DIF can measure Internalizing and Total Problems equally as well as the full item sets, with slightly lower reliability for Externalizing, and can be crosswalked to the metric of the full item set, enabling calculation of normed T scores based on more robust item sets.","tags":["Differential Item Functioning","Internalizing","Externalizing","Child Behavior Checklist","Psychopathology"],"date":"2023-01-25T00:10:12.996710","doi":"10.1002\/jcv2.12198","subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Psychometrics","Assessment","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Early Childhood","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/436gx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/436gx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/436gx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/436gx","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/jcv2.12198","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_398"}

Cues of masculinity, such as beards, are also known to respond to the local intensity of intrasexual competition. Whether different cues of intrasexual competition interact or have additive effects on behaviour remains unknown. Here we test whether attitudes concerning promiscuity and self-reported mate value are influenced by the relative numbers of women and men, and\/or the frequency of bearded men. We primed subjects (men= 540, women= 522) with one of the nine possible combinations of three sex ratios (female bias 3:1; neutral 1:1; male bias 1:3) and three frequency of beards (0%; 50%; 100%) treatments. To simulate local mating market effects, participants were informed that images were of dating profiles of people \u2018within 5 miles\u2019 of them. After rating each profile for attractiveness, participants were asked to complete the wrongness of promiscuity and self-reported mate value scales. We found that men, but not women, view both male and female promiscuity more negatively when exposed to male-biased sex ratios and rate female promiscuity slightly more negatively when exposed to men with beards than clean-shaven men. The male-specific nature of these effects is consistent with anti-promiscuity attitudes functioning to promote paternity certainty rather than facilitating female-female competition for male investment. We found no evidence of self-reported mate value increasing when individuals were the rarer sex. However, there were sex differences in relative ratings of male and female promiscuity among individuals with more open sociosexual orientations, a finding relevant to the origins of sexual double standards.","tags":["Sex Ratio; Mating Market; Sex Differences; Sexual Double Standard; Mate Value; Online Dating"],"date":"2023-01-25T02:57:08.779679","doi":null,"subjects":["Mating","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8tksj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8tksj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8tksj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8tksj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_399"}

These results indicate that even after memories have been formed, they can still be enhanced by certain psychological and biological processes. Although this benefit of post-encoding stress is well established, the exact mechanisms and limits of this effect are still debated. Determining the effects of other, non-stressful, post-encoding manipulations such as emotional arousal or novel spatial exploration can provide important data for understanding these effects. To this end, we conducted a series of five experiments using the same stimuli and study designs that have been used in post-encoding stress studies. Experiments 1 and 2 examined memory for neutral and negative pictures and found that emotional arousal after learning did not benefit memory. Experiments 3 and 4 examined whether post-encoding emotional arousal might benefit memory for verbal, rather than visual items, but again there was no benefit of post-encoding arousal on either true or false memory. Experiment 5 examined whether a novel exploration task after learning would provide a memory benefit, but again there was no memory benefit. Taken together, these results suggest that post-encoding periods of arousal and novelty do not appear to produce the same types of memory benefits that are produced by stress, which provides further support for the critical role of glucocorticoids in post-encoding memory benefits.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-25T05:04:27.579059","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/w7a4f\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/w7a4f\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/w7a4f","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/w7a4f","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_400"}
{"osf_id":"wgdkx","title":"About time? The role of time perspective in the priority for positive over negative emotion in attention","description":"Compared to younger adults, older adults seem to prioritize processing positive information and deprioritize processing negative information. Known as the positivity effect, its mechanisms remain debated. One explanation of the positivity effect is that older adults are influenced by a sense of limited time left in life to focus more on emotional well-being compared with younger adults. Previous research shows that experimentally manipulating time perspective can mimic the positivity effect in younger adults, however such findings have relied on designs where participants can reflect on emotional images they are viewing. In the current study, we examined if time perspective manipulations would similarly elicit positivity effect patterns in younger adults using an emotion-attention task with rapid stimuli display. Across two experiments (N = 236 and N = 431), we found that time perspective had no influence on biases toward positive over negative emotional stimuli in younger adults. We instead found effects driven by time-related trait biases. We discuss these results as they relate to theories about mechanisms underlying the positivity effect and in the way that time-related biases may change the way individuals perceptually prioritize positive and negative information.","tags":["aging","semester effects","positivity effect","emotion","attention"],"date":"2023-01-25T05:35:21.532248","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wgdkx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wgdkx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wgdkx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wgdkx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_401"}

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the refinement of existing and the designs of effective future NPIs.\nPurpose: To separate between- and temporal within-person associations between mental health, risk cognitions and NPI adherence.\nMethods: Six-month ecological momentary assessment study with six 4-day assessment bouts in 397 German adults.

We used dynamic temporal network analysis to estimate between- person, as well as contemporaneous and temporal within-person effects for distancing and hygiene NPIs.\nResults: Distinct networks of mental health, health cognitions and adherence emerged. Participants with higher control and higher susceptibility were also more adherent. Similar within-person contemporaneous patterns; additionally, distancing and loneliness were associated. Temporally, better adherence to NPIs was associated with better mental health on subsequent days, whereas higher loneliness was associated with better subsequent hygiene adherence.\nConclusion: Findings suggest no negative impact of NPI adherence on mental health or vice versa, but instead suggest that adherence might improve mental health symptoms.

This enabled us to disentangle intergenerational influences via parental genes and parental behaviors (i.e., genetic and environmental transmission, respectively). Fathers reported on their own symptoms and mothers on their own and their child\u2019s symptoms.\nResults: Child ADHD behaviors correlated with their mother\u2019s (0.24) and father\u2019s (0.10) ADHD behaviors. These correlations were largely due to additive genetic transmission. Variation in children\u2019s ADHD behaviors was explained by genetic factors active in both generations (11%) and genetic factors specific to the children (46%), giving a total heritability of 57%. There were small effects of parental ADHD behaviors (2% environmental transmission) and gene-environment correlation (3%). The remaining variability in ADHD behaviors was due to individual-specific environmental factors.\nConclusions: The intergenerational resemblance of ADHD behaviors is primarily due to genetic transmission, with little evidence for parental ADHD behaviors causing children\u2019s ADHD behaviors.

{"osf_id":"dsbec","title":"Is reading for pleasure in adolescence good for mental health? A counterfactual and within-person analysis in a large longitudinal study","description":"Reading has been proposed to be a protective factor in mental health; however, testing this is made challenging by the vulnerability of the reading-mental health association to confounding. In this study, we used two complementary approaches to address this: propensity score matching and random intercepts cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPM) in a large longitudinal study: the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (z-proso). For the counterfactual analyses, mental health outcomes of anxiety, depression, and psychosis-like symptoms were measured at ages 17 and 20 and reading engagement was measured at ages 15 and 17. Matching variables included a wide range of factors potentially related to reading and mental health outcomes and when matched with respect to these covariates, there was no consistent effect of reading for pleasure on anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Similarly, using an RI-CLPM to account for between-person stable confounding factors suggested no evidence for a positive effect of reading on later mental health across ages 13,15,17 and 20. The only significant effects were detrimental effects of reading on anxiety and psychosis at age 20 when using non-bi-partite matching.

{"osf_id":"e6px5","title":"Does semantic similarity affect immediate memory for order? Usually not, but sometimes it does","description":"Recall performance in working memory (WM) is strongly affected by the similarity between items. When asked to encode and recall list of items in their serial order, people confuse more often the position of similar compared to dissimilar items. Models of WM explain this deleterious effect of similarity through a problem of discriminability between WM representations. In contrast, when lists of items that are all semantically similar are compared to lists of dissimilar items, semantic similarity does not negatively impact order memory, questioning the idea that semantic information is part of the WM content. This study reports four experiments in which semantic similarity was manipulated using lists composed of multiple semantic categories. These experiments revealed two main patterns. First, semantic similarity can increase, rather than decrease, order memory. Second, semantic knowledge reliably constrains the way items migrate; when migrating, items tend to do so more often toward the position of other similar items, rather than migrating toward other dissimilar items. These results challenge the way current models of WM represent similarity. The plausibility of different theoretical accounts and mechanisms is discussed.","tags":["Semantic knowledge","Order memory","Semantic similarity","Working memory"],"date":"2023-01-25T13:48:01.752263","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e6px5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/e6px5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/e6px5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e6px5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_410"}
{"osf_id":"t4bvd","title":"'Obedient, but cheeky': Guardian Expectations of Canine Behavior and Companionship","description":"Whilst dogs are adored companions worldwide, with an array of benefits associated with their companionship, high numbers continue to be relinquished each year due to perceived behavioural concerns. Subsequently, this paper addresses the question; What are guardian\u2019s expectations of canine behaviour and companionship? Following a reflexive thematic analysis, five themes are discussed; A well-balanced dog, Obedient, Affection and Connection, Shared Interests, and Commitment.  The findings highlight a wide range of expectations typically moving beyond realistic capabilities for both dogs and their guardians. Resultantly, we call for clearer conceptualization of canine behaviour, particularly in relation to the distinction between observable behaviour and behavioural interpretations (personality, temperament etc.). The findings build on the Perceived Canine Reactivity Framework aimed at accounting for the interplay between canine characteristics, human expectations and human capabilities when interpreting dog behaviour. Clarification on the facets of dog behaviour, in addition to better understanding guardian expectations, will aid the development of educational materials aimed at supporting existing human-dog relationships and the adoption matching process within canine adoptions. Accumulatively, this would aid successful human-dog bonding, reducing the risk for relinquishment.","tags":["Relinquishment","Canine Behaviour","Dog Behaviour","Guardian Expectations","Bond"],"date":"2023-01-25T14:02:44.424425","doi":null,"subjects":["Animal Learning and Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/t4bvd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/t4bvd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/t4bvd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/t4bvd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_411"}

A Conceptual Framework of Sexual Pleasure and the Sexual Response.","description":"[June 12 2023: Please consult and cite the published manuscript in the International Journal of Sexual Health: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/19317611.2023.2212663.] Sexual pleasure is central to current understandings of sexual function, health, and wellbeing. In this article, we suggest that we lack a sufficiently specific, yet encompassing, definition of sexual pleasure and that we therefore lack comprehensive assessments of sexual pleasure. We introduce a definition of sexual pleasure and position it centrally in an adapted framework of the sexual response. In the framework, we include a taxonomy of rewards which can be retrieved from sex and thereby aim to capture the multifaceted nature of sexual pleasure. We arrive at the definition, framework, and taxonomy by integrating theories of sexual motivation and response with the literature on sexual pleasure and basic rewards. We position this literature within theories of affect and personality which allows us to differentiate between the experience of and the tendency to experience sexual pleasure (i.e., state versus trait sexual pleasure). We shortly discuss how this conceptualization of sexual pleasure could be reflected in self-report assessments to quantitatively assess sexual pleasure. The framework may aid to focus on the role of the diverse facets of sexual pleasure in sexual function, health, and wellbeing and contribute to giving sexual pleasure the center position it deserves in sex research and therapy.

{"osf_id":"u9y5g","title":"Evidence for a Vicious Socio-Emotional Cycle of Negative Emotions and Interpersonal Conflict","description":"Objective: Interpersonal and emotional functioning are closely linked, and reciprocally influence one another. Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory (CIIT) offers a useful framework to study these patterns. Stress processes offer several candidate targets for empirical investigation with methods that allow for fine-grained analyses in the context of daily life. \nMethod: Four samples of adults (Sample 1 N=145; Sample 2 N=160; Sample 3 N=297; Sample 4=89 dyads, 178 individuals) completed ecological momentary assessment protocols focused on a variety of interpersonal and emotional experiences (Sample 1 Observation N= 14,219; Sample 2 Observation N=8,137; Sample 3 Observation N=5,400; Sample 4 Observation N=5,537). Samples were enriched for aggressive and self-harming behavior (Sample 1), trait hostility (Sample 2), interpersonal problems (Sample 3), and personality disorder features (Sample 4). \nResults: Using multilevel dynamic structural equation modeling, we investigated how emotions and interpersonal functioning operate over brief timescales in daily life. We found evidence for a normative vicious socio-emotional cycle across all four samples, whereby negative emotions led to interpersonal conflict (i.e., perceptions of and enacting cold, antagonistic, or quarrelsome behavior) which in turn led to increased negative emotions. Although individuals differed in the strength of this process, it was unrelated to trait negative affectivity. \nConclusions: Viewing these results through the lens of CIIT, we discuss multiple intervention points highlighted by these dynamic results whereby the vicious cycle can be changed.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-25T14:38:14.063642","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u9y5g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/u9y5g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/u9y5g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u9y5g","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_414"}

Methodology: The number of child marriage dispensation cases were analyzed together with other socioeconomic variables, including poverty and jobless rates, junior and senior high school completion rates, number of cerai talak and cerai gugat applications, number of COVID-19 positive cases, and number of deaths by COVID-19. The differences between 2021 and 2019 were analyzed using the paired t-test and repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The relationship between variables were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Hierarchical multiple regression with entering method was used to determine the predictors of the number of child marriage dispensation cases in year 2019, 2020, 2021, and the change from 2019 to 2021. Findings: New dispensation underage marriage applications in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were 24,457 (M=843, SD=1,519), 63,391 (M=2,186, SD=4,085), and 62,167 (M=2,144, SD=4,058), which were significantly different (F(1.0, 28.6)=7.63, p=.01) and positively correlated with poverty rate, jobless rate, cerai talak, cerai gugat, COVID-19 positive cases, and COVID-19 death cases. The multiple regression analysis for the change of dispensation underage marriage applications in the pandemic and before (years 2021-2019) was statistically significant, (F(6,22)=117.62, p&lt;.001), which the final model was able to account for 97% of the variance in new dispensation underage marriage applications.

{"osf_id":"erhdz","title":"A window to future social interactions: Evidence for association, but not for interaction, of childhood adversity and identity development with threat anticipation in adolescence","description":"Introduction: Childhood adversity may result in a negative expectation of future interactions with others, also referred to as \u2018threat anticipation\u2019. It may also negatively impact on identity development, which subsequently may influence how individuals deal with their environment. Here, we examine the hypotheses that 1) identity development is associated with threat anticipation, and 2) that identity confusion, in the presence of childhood adversity, has a synergistic effect on the development of threat anticipation.  \nMethods: 1913 adolescents from the general population (mean age = 13.8 years, SD = 1.86, range = 11-20) completed self-report questionnaires assessing exposure to childhood adversity, identity development and threat anticipation. \nResults: Identity development was significantly associated with threat anticipation in the expected direction: identity synthesis was associated with reduced anticipation of threat (\u03b2 = -.0013, p &lt; .001), whereas identity confusion was association with increased threat anticipation (\u03b2 = .0017, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, childhood adversity was positively associated with threat anticipation (\u03b2 = .0018, p &lt; .001). However, no evidence for an interaction effect of identity on the association between childhood adversity and threat anticipation was found.\nConclusion: The current study illustrates the importance of exposure to childhood adversity and identity development for the anticipation of threat. Identity development however did not moderate the association between childhood adversity and threat anticipation, suggesting childhood adversity and identity development have an additive rather than synergistic effect on threat anticipation. Further research is needed to clarify how both factors influence each other within a developmental framework.","tags":["threat anticipation","adolescence","identity","childhood adversity"],"date":"2023-01-25T15:22:17.662748","doi":null,"subjects":["Adolescence","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/erhdz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/erhdz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/erhdz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/erhdz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_416"}
{"osf_id":"dxz5h","title":"Disjunctions, Metadisjunctions, and Mental Models","description":"A disjunction of two assertions, Either p or else q, but not both, where p and q are everyday assertions, is equivalent to a metadisjunction, such as:\n\tWitness 1 asserts p.\n\tWitness 2 asserts q.\n\tOne witness is telling the truth, and one witness is lying.\nIn normal logics, the disjunction and metadisjunction have the same \u2018truth-functional\u2019 meanings: they are true provided that one of their two clauses, p and q, is true and one of them is false. The theory of mental models differs: the disjunction refers to a conjunction of two possibilities, p and q, that hold in default of knowledge to the contrary. Intuitive models represent the two possibilities as p and as q; deliberative models represent them as p and not-q and as not-p and q. Four experiments showed that people tend to rely on intuitive models, which for certain predictable inferences lead them into systematic errors. They also showed that participants infer that a metadisjunction of assertions of explicit possibilities: possibly p or possibly q implies possibly p. This inference violates all normal logics, which rely on the truth-functional meaning of disjunctions. A similar well-known \u2018paradox\u2019 concerns permission, e.g.: You can have a court-appointed lawyer or a private lawyer; therefore, you can have a private lawyer. The multitude of theories of these paradoxes either maintain the truth-functions semantics and posit that disjunctions yield pragmatic inferences, or else, like the model theory, posit an alternative semantics. Our results are contrary to the pragmatic accounts, because a metadisjunction depends, not on a single disjunction, but on several assertions.","tags":["mental models","free choice permissions","metadisjunctions","disjunctions","truth-functional semantics","prragmatics"],"date":"2023-01-25T15:55:44.086181","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dxz5h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/dxz5h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/dxz5h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dxz5h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_417"}

{"osf_id":"qx4zg","title":"Prosodic marking of information status in Italian. Sbranna et al 2023","description":"Previous studies on the prosodic marking of information status argue that Italian tends to resist deaccentuation of given elements. In particular, Italian reportedly always accents post-focal given information within noun phrases (NPs), so that it is not possible to reliably reconstruct the information status of the items from the acoustic signal. However, descriptions have so far been concerned with categorical accent patterns, lacking crucial information about continuous phonetic parameters and their distribution in the utterance in ways that can contribute to prosodic marking. In this paper, we use a novel approach based on periodic-energy-related measures to explore how speakers of the Neapolitan variety of Italian modulate continuous prosodic parameters to differentiate information structure. We show that, contrary to previous findings, Italian speakers of the Neapolitan variety do mark information status prosodically within noun phrases. The discrepancy with previous work is explained by the fact that the prosodic marking of post-focal givenness is not achieved through the categorical presence or absence of a pitch accent on one specific syllable, but through the gradual modulation of phonetic parameters at various locations.

We also show that native speakers can make use of their knowledge of these modulations to reliably identify post-focal given elements in the absence of the pragmatic context, that is, directly from the acoustic signal.","tags":["prosodic marking of information status","Italian L1","prosodic prominence","periodic energy","continuous phonetic parameters"],"date":"2023-01-25T17:21:50.040215","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qx4zg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qx4zg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qx4zg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qx4zg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_420"}

{"osf_id":"e3pu9","title":"INTERACTION BETWEEN MULTISENSORY INFORMATION AND EMOTIONAL ACTIVATION IN VIDEO-FACILITATED PSYCHOTHERAPY","description":"Emotional activation is regarded as central in psychotherapy. We have developed a method called VideoTalk, where patients video themselves at home according to the therapist\u2019s instructions, and the videos are watched together in the therapy session. The aim of the study was to find out whether watching and listening to a video in psychotherapy readily activates the patient's emotions. The video material was analyzed by theory-based content analysis using the Interactive Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) theory. The ICS theory suggests a link between sensory information and emotions and describes two levels of meaning: propositional and implicational. The implicational level gains information from the propositional level and directly from perceptions and is central to the activation of emotions. Five patients participated in our schema therapy-based intervention. Our material included videos of ten therapy sessions, where the patient and the therapist watched a video made by the patient at home in a state of helplessness. Watching the video in the session was done in parts, and between watching periods there were observation phases consisting of discussion about what the patient had seen and heard on the video and how it affected them. Our data included 38 observation phases, and in 35 of these the patient verbalized an emotion after watching the video. The implicational level was involved in almost all observation phases where the patient verbalized emotions. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that added multisensory information via video enhances input to the implicational level and therefore emotional activation in psychotherapy. This is a possible mechanism by which the use of VideoTalk could facilitate the psychotherapy process.","tags":["activating emotions","directed content analysis","sensory perceptions","psychotherapy","video work"],"date":"2023-01-25T18:19:58.503425","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e3pu9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/e3pu9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/e3pu9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e3pu9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_422"}

We propose three directions to propel social cognition research on Asian Americans. First, research emphasizes Asian Americans\u2019 perceived high status (i.e., the model minority stereotype) while often overlooking their perceived foreignness. The two-dimensional Racial Position Model elucidates the consequences of being stereotyped as perpetual foreigners for Asian Americans and their relations with other racial and ethnic groups. Second, research and laypeople alike consider East Asian Americans to be the prototypical Asian Americans, thereby excluding subgroups such as South and Southeast Asian Americans. Considering the ethnic diversity of Asian Americans challenges and extends existing social psychological theories. Lastly, much of psychological research approaches race in isolation without considering its intersection with other identities such as gender. An intersectional framework offers insights into how Asian Americans\u2019 gender and race overlap in our social cognition. More nuanced research on Asian Americans is needed to fully understand race relations in the 21st century and we hope these three interconnected directions can guide researchers who are interested in the topic.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-25T20:16:01.997777","doi":null,"subjects":["Diversity","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/a69tz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/a69tz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/a69tz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/a69tz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_424"}
{"osf_id":"87pmy","title":"Syntactic theory of mathematical expressions","description":"Mathematical expressions consist of recursive combinations of numbers, variables, and operators. Theoretical linguists argue that the syntactic mechanisms for natural language also provide a basis for mathematics; however, to date, no attempt is made to support such arguments in a theoretically rigorous manner. The current study uses a methodology adopted in theoretical linguistics to analyze the syntactic properties of mathematical expressions. By reviewing recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies on mathematical syntax, we report that their analyses contain several inconsistencies with theoretical linguistics such as the use of ternary structures. We propose that a syntactic category called Applicative plays a central role in analyzing mathematical expressions with seemingly ternary structures by combining binary structures. In addition to basic arithmetic expressions, we demonstrate analyses on algebraic equations and complex expressions such as integral and differential calculi. The current study is the first attempt to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing the syntactic structures of mathematical expressions.","tags":["","Theoretical linguistics","Tree structures","Syntax","Numerical cognition","Mathematics"],"date":"2023-01-25T20:25:05.060139","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/87pmy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/87pmy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/87pmy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/87pmy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_425"}

A goal of memory science is to understand the factors that give rise to individual and group differences in memory-dependent cognition. In two experiments, we examined associative inference performance in young and older adults and how differences in sustained attention relate to differences in memory and inference. We report lower associative memory and inference performance in older compared to young adults; strikingly, age-related reductions in associative inference occur even when controlling for associative memory and in the absence of group-differences in attention. At the same time, we report that individual differences in sustained attention explain between-person variability in memory and inference performance. While age-related reductions in associative memory and inference performance can occur independent of attention, individual differences in the propensity to suffer attention lapses partially explain why some young and older adults remember and bridge across experiences better than others.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-26T03:58:14.939258","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Life Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sk9c6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/sk9c6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/sk9c6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sk9c6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_427"}

In this study, we examined whether working memory can buffer against the development of secondary hypersensitivity. Thirty-five healthy women participated in three experimental conditions. In each condition they underwent electrical stimulation of the skin for 2 minutes (middle-frequency electrical stimulation, MFS), which induces secondary hypersensitivity. During MFS, participants executed either an individually tailored and rewarded n-back task (working memory condition), a rewarded reaction-time task (non-working memory condition), or no task at all (control condition). Before and after MFS, participants rated the self-reported intensity and unpleasantness of mechanical pinprick stimuli. Fear of MFS was also assessed. Heart rate variability was measured to examine potential differences between the three conditions and steady-state evoked potentials to the electrical stimulation were recorded to investigate differences in cortical responses. We report no significant difference in hypersensitivity between the three conditions. Moreover, engaging in the cognitive tasks did not affect the heart rate variability or the steady-state evoked potentials. Interestingly, higher fear of MFS predicted greater hypersensitivity. In conclusion, we found no evidence that working memory affects the plasticity of the nociceptive system, yet pain-related fear plays a role.","tags":["secondary hyperalgesia","working memory capacity","attentional control","central sensitization","steady-state evoked potentials","pain catastrophizing","cognitive load","fear of pain","heart rate variability","working memory","pain vigilance and awareness"],"date":"2023-01-26T09:22:15.287794","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2cvk7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2cvk7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2cvk7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2cvk7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_428"}
{"osf_id":"tqyux","title":"Moving Intelligence Measurement Online:  Adaptation and Validation of the Polish Version of the Pathfinder General Cognitive Ability Test","description":"Online measurement is on the rise in every subdiscipline of the major social sciences, such as psychology, sociology or educational studies. This trend may stem from the numerous advantages offered by this mode of data collection, including the facts that it is cost-efficient and enables the collection of large and diversified samples quickly. However, online studies have their own requirements, and one of them is having measurement tools available that have been adapted for online assessment in terms of their design, length, and attractiveness and are as valid and reliable as their traditional counterparts. These new needs in intelligence research were recently addressed by the creation of Pathfinder, a novel online, gamified, psychometrically sound general cognitive ability (g-score) measure. In this article, we aimed to offer further validation for and proof of concept of Pathfinder by presenting the results of its first language adaptation. The results of our adaptation showed that the Polish version of Pathfinder is a reliable and valid measurement tool suited for several research conditions. They therefore supported the applicability of Pathfinder for different linguistic and cultural contexts.","tags":["Polish adaptation","general cognitive ability","intelligence","gamified measures","Pathfinder","online assessment","validation"],"date":"2023-01-26T10:30:59.313107","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychometrics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tqyux\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tqyux\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tqyux","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tqyux","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_429"}

In light of research on the psychology of morality, we examined whether confronting people with evidence of their own (group\u2019s) bias causes a (psychophysiological) threat response, and how to overcome this. We focused on an intervention addressing gender bias in teacher evaluations. After assessing their own teaching evaluations, we presented student research participants (N = 101; 71.3% female), in Part 1 of the intervention, with evidence of bias displayed in such teaching evaluations. This evidence either did (self-implied condition) or did not (self not-implied condition) include participants\u2019 own ostensibly biased evaluations. In Part 2 of the intervention, we asked participants to reflect on the issue of gender bias, and compared the impact of two experimental instructions. In the promotion condition, instructions referred to emphasizing how the university could try to achieve the ideal of promoting fair and just evaluations of teachers. In the prevention condition, instructions referred to highlighting the university\u2019s obligation to prevent unfair and unjust teacher evaluations. While participants verbally reflected on the intervention, during both phases (in Part 1 and Part 2) we measured their psychophysiological responses using indices of cardiovascular \u2018threat vs. challenge\u2019. Then, we used self-report measures to examine participants\u2019 explicit responses to the different parts of the intervention. Results revealed that implicating the self in the occurrence of bias (Part 1) raises a psychophysiological threat response. However, emphasizing the future ideal of promoting fair evaluations of teachers (rather than the obligation of preventing biased evaluations; Part 2) resulted in a psychophysiological challenge response and increased perceived coping abilities to combat such bias. The implications of these findings are discussed.","tags":["Social bias","moral ideals and opportunities","cardiovascular measures","anti-bias intervention","threat vs challenge"],"date":"2023-01-26T11:33:23.719892","doi":null,"subjects":["Diversity","Social and Personality Psychology","Moral Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Interventions"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/evz8s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/evz8s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/evz8s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/evz8s","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_430"}
{"osf_id":"r28uq","title":"More is Not Necessarily Better: How Different Aspects of Sensorimotor Experience Affect Recognition Memory for Words","description":"Semantic richness theory predicts that words with richer, more distinctive semantic representations should facilitate performance in a word recognition memory task. We investigated the contribution of multiple aspects of sensorimotor experience \u2013 those relating to the body, communication, food, and objects \u2013 to word recognition memory, by analysing megastudy data in a series of hierarchical linear regressions. We found that different forms of sensorimotor experience produced different effects on memory. While stronger grounding in object- and food-related experience facilitated word memory performance as expected for semantic richness, experience relating to communication did not. Critically, sensorimotor experience relating to the body impaired rather than facilitated recognition memory by inflating false alarms, which was not consistent with the idea that semantically-richer representations are more memorable. Additionally, we found that pure imageability (i.e., consciously generating mental imagery, distinct from sensorimotor experience) contributes to semantic richness effects on word memory but with much smaller effect sizes than previously reported, once sensorimotor grounding was taken into account. These results suggest that word recognition memory is often but not consistently facilitated by rich semantic representations, and that it is essential to separately consider distinct forms of sensorimotor experience rather than assuming more information is always better. The findings have implications for the use of semantic variables in memory research.","tags":["semantic richness","word memory","imageability","sensorimotor information"],"date":"2023-01-26T11:38:42.893207","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Imagery","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r28uq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r28uq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r28uq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r28uq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_431"}

While the effect of missing audiences has been studied numerously in team sports with diverse effects, studies on individual performances are rare. The current investigation analyzes individual performances of professional dart players over 4 years in (a) the absence of spectators, (b) the presence of noisy, real crowds, and (c) artificial crowd noise (simulated crowds) substituting live spectators during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDarts is a coordination-based accuracy task requiring full attention. Empirical evidence suggests that performances in coordination-based accuracy tasks are negatively impacted by the presence of others. Therefore, following the results regarding the impact of sport spectators on motor tasks, we hypothesize that tournament performance of elite darts players deteriorates in the presence of a real audience (RA) in comparison to no audience (NA) and a simulated- audience (SA).\nData from professional darts ranking tournaments from 2018 to 2021 was retrieved from dart- sorakel.com. The sample consisted of N=442 players (98.8% male) and N=26,724 individual performances.\nThe influence of RA and SA on checkout percentage (CP) and three-dart average (3DA) was analyzed using separate multilevel models, controlling for player rank, round of the tournament, year, and CP (for 3DA). Competing with SA and RA resulted in decreased CP with an effect of b(stand_real)=-.20, p&lt;.001, and b(stand_sim)=-.14, p&lt;.001. 3DA increased with SA, b(stand_sim)= .08, p&lt;.001, and decreased with a RA, b(stand_sim)= -.07, p&lt;.001.\nCrowds appear to have a negative effect on the coordination-based task darts, yet effect sizes are negligible to small.

However, the study of dynamics in consciousness has been largely neglected. Aru and Bachmann have recently brought to the attention of scientists dealing with consciousness the relevance of making inquiries about its temporal evolution. Importantly, they also pointed out several experimental questions as guidelines for researchers interested in studying the temporal evolution of consciousness, including the phases of formation and dissolution of content. They also suggested that these two phases could be characterized by asymmetric inertia. The main objective of the present investigation was to implement and validate a method to approximate the dynamics of these two phases. To this aim, we tested the time course of content transitions during a binocular rivalry task using face stimuli and asked participants to map their subjective experience of transitions from one content to the other through a joystick. We then computed metrics of joystick velocity linked to content transitions as proxies of the formation and dissolution phases. We found a general phase effect such that the formation phase was slower than the dissolution phase. Furthermore, we observed an effect specific to happy facial expressions, such that their contents were slower to form and dissolve than that of neutral expressions. We further propose to include a third phase of stabilization of conscious content between formation and dissolution. To conclude, the method and the metrics we propose seem to provide a good proxy to study the temporal evolution of consciousness.","tags":["Happy Expressions","Facial expression","Joystick","Consciousness Time Course","Binocular Rivalry"],"date":"2023-01-26T13:09:12.097188","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Perception","Embodied Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u24gt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/u24gt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/u24gt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u24gt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_434"}
{"osf_id":"wq7pf","title":"Different electrophysiological signatures of similarity-induced and Stroop-like interference in language production","description":"Contextual similarity between targets and competitors, whether semantic or phonological, often leads to behavioral interference in language production. It has been assumed that resolving such interference relies on control processes similar to those involved in tasks such as Stroop. This paper tests this assumption by comparing the electrophysiological signatures of interference resulting from a contextual similarity vs. a Stroop-like manipulation. In blocks containing two items, participants repeatedly named pictures that were semantically related, phonologically related or unrelated (contextual similarity manipulation). In straight blocks, the pictures were named by their canonical names. In reverse blocks, participants had to reverse the names (Stroop-like manipulation). Both manipulations led to behavioral interference, but with different electrophysiological profiles. Whole-scalp stimulus-locked and response-locked analyses of semantic and phonological similarity pointed to a system with global modularity with some degree of cascading and interactivity, whereas the effect of phase reversal was sustained and of the opposite polarity. More strikingly, a representational similarity analysis showed a biphasic pattern for Stroop-like reversal, with earlier higher similarity scores for the reverse phase flipping into lower scores ~500 ms post-stimulus onset. In contrast, contextual similarity induced higher similarity scores up to articulation. Finally, response-locked mediofrontal components indexing performance monitoring differed between manipulations. Correct response negativity\u2019s (CRN) amplitude was lower in the phonological blocks, whereas a pre-CRN component had higher amplitude in reverse vs. straight blocks. These results argue against the involvement of Stroop-like control mechanisms in resolving interference from contextual similarity in language production.","tags":["semantic interference","Stroop","ERN\/CRN","conflict detection","phonological interference","inhibitory control","language production","EEG"],"date":"2023-01-26T13:21:21.383777","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wq7pf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wq7pf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wq7pf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wq7pf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_435"}

In this vein, recent models propose a key role for the somatosensory cortex (SC) in emotion recognition. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the subjective experience from the perception of a facial expression is linked with responses in the SC but not with responses in the motor cortex. Furthermore, models of sensorimotor simulation converge on the idea that somatosensory representations and visual representations are integrated. Here, we want to test whether somatosensory activity during the perception of facial expressions has a role in conscious processing of such expressions, an issue that has been ignored by previous research. To this aim we will present facial expressions in binocular rivalry, a well-suited paradigm employed in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of conscious visual perception. We expect that congruent tactile facial stimulation with the somatosensory representations of happy expressions will favor the conscious content of happy facial expressions and interfere with conscious processing of neutral expressions compared to the absence of tactile stimulation.","tags":["tactile stimulation","binocular rivalry","facial expression","preregistration","somatosensory"],"date":"2023-01-26T14:02:05.489460","doi":null,"subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Embodied Cognition","Consciousness","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n5qby\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/n5qby\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/n5qby","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n5qby","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_438"}

In the present study, 24 DPs and 110 age-matched controls completed the Cambridge Face and Bicycle Memory Tests, old new faces task, and a famous faces test. We used accuracy and the Balanced Integration Score (BIS), a measure that adjusts accuracy for RTs, to classify our sample at the group and individual level. Subjective face recognition ability was assessed using the PI20 questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Fifteen DPs showed a major impairment using BIS compared with only five using accuracy alone. Logistic regression showed that a model incorporating the BIS measures was the most sensitive for classifying DP and showed highest area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, larger between-group effect sizes were observed for a derived global (averaged) memory measure calculated using BIS vs accuracy alone.  BIS is thus an extremely sensitive novel measure for attenuating speed-accuracy trade-offs that can otherwise mask impairment measured only by accuracy in DP.","tags":["Adults","Face recognition","Developmental prosopagnosia","Face processing","Humans","Children"],"date":"2023-01-26T14:19:59.083253","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g85k7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/g85k7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/g85k7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g85k7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_439"}

The traditional view in philosophy is that it is, although convincing arguments have also been offered for the view that lying and misleading are morally equal (Saul, 2012a). I here report the results of addressing this question empirically. Specifically, I tested ordinary English speakers\u2019 intuitions on the question whether the moral status of lying versus misleading depends on whether it is overall forbidden, permissible, or obligatory to deceive someone. Timmermann &amp; Viebahn (2021) recently proposed that lies are, on average, stronger causes of false beliefs than misleading statements. When morality demands that we deceive someone (such as Kant\u2019s murderer at the door, asking for the location of his innocent victims), lying may thus even be morally better than misleading, since lying is the stronger cause of a desirable outcome here. I could confirm that people take lies to be the more reliable means of deception than misleading statements, possibly because they take speakers to be more committed to the deceptive content of their utterance when they lie. When deception was forbidden, lying was accordingly judged as morally worse than misleading, as Timmermann and Viebahn\u2019s (2021) account predicts. In cases of obligatory deception, lying was indeed sometimes seen as morally better than misleading (in a scenario modelled closely on the murderer at the door case), but not in two other tested scenarios. I discuss possible reasons and outline avenues for further research. Since lying and misleading are concepts that are deeply embedded in everyday life and discourse, I argue that philosophers should take ordinary speakers\u2019 moral intuitions on this matter seriously.","tags":["misleading","experimental philosophy","moral judgment","lying"],"date":"2023-01-26T17:26:25.103644","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/habrm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/habrm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/habrm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/habrm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_443"}

Theoretical consideration indicated that this was a necessary consequence of the relationship of pace and its inverse error to the cumulative distribution function, assuming a normal dependent variable and linear approximations. Simulation supported this speculation.  With empirical data, it was confirmed that pace and erf.inv were linearly related to the residuals of logarithmic RT (correlations &gt;0.95). Importantly, response times in either their logarithmic transform or raw metric (seconds), were also well predicted. Thus, pace or erf.inv provide approximations to response time residuals in assessments and in conjunction with QTI can also predict assessment RT.

Consequentially, individuals often explore by focusing on areas of uncertainty in the environment. However, people sometimes adopt the opposite strategy, one of avoiding uncertainty. How are the conflicting tendencies to approach and avoid uncertainty reconciled in human exploration? We hypothesized that the balance between avoiding and approaching uncertainty can be understood by considering capacity constraints. Accordingly, people are expected to approach uncertainty in most cases, but to avoid it when overall uncertainty is highest. To test this, we developed a new task and used modeling to compare human choices to a range of plausible policies. The task required participants to learn the statistics of a simulated environment by active exploration. On each trial, participants chose to explore a better-known or lesser-known option. Participants generally chose to approach uncertainty, however, when overall uncertainty about the choice options was highest, they instead avoided uncertainty and chose to sample better-known objects. This strategy was associated with faster decisions and, despite reducing the rate of observed information, it did not impair learning. We suggest that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty reduces the cognitive costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.","tags":["resource rationality","exploration","uncertainty","rational analysis","learning"],"date":"2023-01-26T19:31:56.727583","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gtxam\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gtxam\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gtxam","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gtxam","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_445"}

Computer-based tailoring is an alternative, allowing automated tailoring of information presented to patients based on their interactions with a computer app. The purpose of this article is to describe our process in developing a series of modules for chronic disease self-management for persons 40 years of age or older with one or more chronic health conditions.","tags":["health literacy","health disparities","chronic disease self management","computer delivered health information"],"date":"2023-01-26T20:18:02.796914","doi":null,"subjects":["Educational Psychology","Neuroscience","Life Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Health Psychology","Learning Process","Psychiatry","Learning Situation","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/98bxk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/98bxk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/98bxk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/98bxk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_446"}

The influence that the overrepresentation of idealized bodies in Western media plays on women\u2019s body dissatisfaction has been well-documented, but less is known about how this process affects men. In this study, we proposed that prevalence-induced concept change (PICC) may be one of the cognitive mechanisms that explains how masculine beauty standards shift. We conducted an online within-subjects experiment with young men (N = 164) and found that when the prevalence of muscular bodies in the environment increased participants increasingly judged objectively average bodies as non-muscular. This effect was not present when men made judgements about overweightness. Computational modeling revealed that concept change was driven by reduced response caution when judging muscular stimuli. Taken together, the current results show that men\u2019s judgments about other male bodies and their own bodies are biased by an overrepresentation of muscularity.","tags":["cognitive","concept creep","decision-making","body image","bias","prevalence induced concept change","social","drift diffusion"],"date":"2023-01-26T20:27:46.619196","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Concepts and Categories"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q5vfb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/q5vfb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/q5vfb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q5vfb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_447"}

{"osf_id":"nj6dg","title":"Safe Working with Forklifts: Investigating the effect of forklift operators\u2019 behaviors, skills and effort-reward imbalance on forklift accidents","description":"Introduction: Emerging needs for logistics increased the use of forklifts last century. The extensive range in capacity and function for forklifts has eased transportation substantially. Literature supported the relationship between self-reported behaviors and skills and the accident involvement of drivers. Although driver operators\u2019 behaviors and skills have been thoroughly researched last three decades, forklift operators\u2019 behaviors and skills have not been researched yet to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, effort-reward imbalance and overcommitment were related to employees\u2019 behaviors and other outcomes in the workplace. In light of this, the present study aimed to develop measurements for the behaviors and skills of forklift operators and to investigate the roles of effort-reward imbalance in accidents through behaviors and skills by overcommitment. Methods: First, the Forklift Operator Behavior Questionnaire (FOBQ) and the Forklift Operator Skill Inventory (FOSI) were derived from the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), the Driver Skill Inventory (DSI), accident reports, and information taken from forklift operators. The empirical data were gathered with three questionnaires filled in by 227 counterbalance forklift operators with the FOBQ, FOSI, and the Effort-Reward Imbalance model. Results: The FOBQ has shown a four-factor structure; transgression, rule-based violations, contextual violations, and end-result violations, and the FOSI has provided a two-factor structure made up of safety skills and perceptual motor skills. Transgression and end-result violations were positively related to forklift accidents; effort-reward imbalance was indirectly associated with accidents through transgression. Implications: With the current study, two measurements for behaviors and skills of forklift operators were introduced to the literature, along with the relations of effort and reward on accident involvement and buffering role of overcommitment on skills and behaviors. Occupational safety and health professionals could seek ways to eliminate sources of  errors and violations.","tags":["forklift safety","forklift operator behaviors","forklift operator skills","effort-reward imbalance","accidents"],"date":"2023-01-26T22:17:05.977331","doi":null,"subjects":["Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nj6dg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nj6dg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nj6dg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nj6dg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_451"}

{"osf_id":"bg496","title":"A Flexible Threshold Theory of Change Perception in Self, Others, and The World","description":"This article proposes a flexible threshold theory of change perception in self and social judgment. People\u2019s thresholds for judging change depend not only on the salience and quality of the evidence for change but also on people\u2019s beliefs about the extent to which acknowledging change would disrupt their immediate situation, and people typically prefer to avoid disruption. Accordingly, variables that exacerbate perceived disruption costs should lead people to contract their change thresholds (i.e., people should be slower and less open to concluding things have changed\u2014and hence be less likely to take action) whereas variables that alleviate perceived disruption costs should lead people to expand their change thresholds (i.e., people should be quicker and more open to concluding things have changed\u2014and hence be more likely to take action), even going beyond the salience and quality of the evidence. Moreover, these effects should emerge independently from change direction (i.e., for both declines and improvements alike) so long as signs of change bear on perceived disruption costs. I review empirical support for these propositions and use the theory to generate novel predictions, contributions, and applications. The theory offers novel explanations for diverse self and social phenomena, from how people respond (or fail to respond) to fluctuating climates and economies to how people respond (or fail to respond) to worsening personal conditions and burgeoning social progress. People flexibly adjust their thresholds for judging change from the past based on how they think it will affect their presents. This flexibility is adaptive at short time horizons but maladaptive at long time horizons.","tags":["Social psychology","Change perception","Social judgment","Cognitive psychology","Motivated cognition","Self judgment","Thresholds","Time"],"date":"2023-01-27T02:51:19.548426","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bg496\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bg496\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bg496","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bg496","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_453"}

Further, this relationship is moderated by adult attachment styles. However, these effects have not been characterized in experimentally induced symptoms of chronic pain, like Secondary Hyperalgesia (SH) which is characterized by an increased sensitivity of the skin surrounding an injury. We aimed to examine whether social support via handholding from a romantic partner can attenuate the development of experimentally induced SH. Thirty-seven women, along with their partners, participated in two experimental sessions one week apart. In both sessions, SH was induced using an electrical stimulation protocol. In the support condition, the partner was seated across from the participant holding the participant\u2019s hand during the electrical stimulation, while in the alone condition, the participant went through the stimulation alone. Heart rate variability was measured for both the participant as well as the partner before, during and after the stimulation. We found that the width of the area of hyperalgesia was significantly smaller in the support condition and there was a similar non-significant trend in the\nlength. Although attachment styles did not moderate this effect, increasing attachment avoidance was associated with both, a smaller width of hyperalgesia, and a smaller increase in the sensitivity on the stimulated arm. For the first time, we show that social support can attenuate the development of secondary hyperalgesia and that attachment avoidance may be associated with an attenuated development of secondary hyperalgesia.","tags":["social support","secondary hyperalgesia","attachment","electrical stimulation","pain","heart rate variability"],"date":"2023-01-27T07:56:32.164962","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Interpersonal Relationships"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nsg3v\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nsg3v\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nsg3v","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nsg3v","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_454"}

Long-form audio-recordings captured spontaneous speech behavior by, and around, 38 children (5-33 months, 23 girls) from 11 villages. Automated analyses revealed most children's vocal input came from female adults and other children\u2019s voices, with small contributions from male adult voices. The greatest changes with age involved an increase in the input vocalizations from other children. Total input (collapsing across child-directed and overheard speech, and across languages) was ~11 minutes per hour, which was at least 5 minutes (31%) lower than that found in other populations studied using comparable methods in previous literature, as well as in archival American data analyzed with the same algorithm. In contrast, children's own vocalization counts were two to four times higher than previous reports for North-American English-learning monolingual infants at matched ages, and comparable to estimates from archival American data, consistent with a resilient language-learning cognitive system for this aspect of vocal development. The strongest association between input and output was with vocalizations by other children, rather than those by adults, which is consistent with research in anthropology but less so with current theoretical trends in developmental psychology. These results invite further research in populations that are under-represented in developmental science.","tags":["infancy","cognitive development","under-represented samples","parental investment","LENA","developmental psychology","vocal development","long-form recordings","phonology","monolingualism","language","childhood","diversity","daylong recordings","speech","multilingualism","vocalizations","developmental anthropology","bilingualism"],"date":"2023-01-27T09:37:25.074150","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Linguistics","Cultural Psychology","Infancy","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","First and Second Language Acquisition","Phonetics and Phonology","Quantitative Psychology","Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics","Typological Linguistics and Linguistic Diversity","Cognitive Development","Language Aquisition","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Early Childhood","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bqya7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bqya7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bqya7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bqya7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_456"}

However, the effect of emotional cues in self-BO, i.e., one\u2019s body odour, is still neglected in the literature. In the present work, we sought to determine for the first time if emotional signals in self-BOs modify the access to visual awareness of emotional faces. Thirty-eight women underwent a breaking-Continuous Flash Suppression (bCFS) task in which they were asked to detect fearful, happy, and neutral faces as quickly and accurately as possible while being exposed to their fearful, happy, and neutral self-Bos, recorded in a previous session, and delivered via an olfactometer. Results showed a main effect of emotional face, with happy faces being consciously detected significantly faster than fearful and neutral faces. However, our hypothesis that fear self-BOs would lead to faster facial expression detection was not confirmed, as no effect of emotional self-BOs was found \u2013 this was confirmed with Bayesian analyses. Although caution is needed when interpreting these results due to the small sample size, our findings, and the literature, suggest that emotional face perception is modulated by emotional other-, but not self-BOs.

{"osf_id":"7jw6v","title":"k-plus Anticlustering: An Improved k-means Criterion for Maximizing Between-Group Similarity","description":"Anticlustering refers to the process of partitioning elements into disjoint groups with the goal of obtaining high between-group similarity and high within-group heterogeneity. Anticlustering thereby reverses the logic of its better known twin\u2014cluster analysis\u2014and is usually approached by maximizing instead of minimizing a clustering objective function. This paper presents k-plus, an extension of the classical k-means objective to maximize between-group similarity in anticlustering applications. K-plus represents between-group similarity as discrepancy in distribution moments (means, variance, and higher order moments), whereas the k-means criterion only reflects groups differences with regard to means. While constituting a new criterion for anticlustering, it is shown that k-plus anticlustering can be implemented by optimizing the original k-means criterion after the input data has been augmented with additional variables. A computer simulation and practical examples show that k-plus anticlustering achieves high between-group similarity with regard to multiple objectives. In particular, optimizing between-group similarity with regard to variances usually does not compromise similarity with regard to means; the k-plus extension is therefore generally preferred over classical k-means anticlustering. Examples are given on how k-plus anticlustering can be applied to real norming data using the open source R package anticlust, which is freely available via CRAN.","tags":["kurtosis","variance","k-means","Maximum Diverse Grouping Problem","Anticlustering","skewness","stimulus selection","k-plus"],"date":"2023-01-27T11:55:12.363079","doi":"10.1111\/bmsp.12315","subjects":["Mathematical Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7jw6v\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7jw6v\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7jw6v","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7jw6v","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/bmsp.12315","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_458"}

{"osf_id":"s5cxt","title":"Effectiveness of an Unguided Online Intervention (PleaSure) for Sexual Pleasure in Women: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study","description":"The importance of sexual pleasure as a factor promoting sexual and public health is increasingly recognized. Nevertheless, hardly any theory-based and empirically tested interventions exist for fostering sexual pleasure. Consequently, we developed an unguided online intervention called PleaSure to promote sexual pleasure in women. In a randomized controlled pilot trial with a mixed-method design, we evaluated the effectiveness of PleaSure by comparing the intervention group to a waitlist control group in pre\u2013post measurements over 4 weeks. With 657 participants (Mage = 31.46, SDage = 8.78), we evaluated an index of sexual pleasure and five facets: sensual pleasure, pleasure-related mastery, pleasure-related validation, interaction pleasure, and bonding pleasure.  The results show that the online intervention primarily strengthened the intrapersonal domain of sexual pleasure by increasing pleasure-related mastery. Neither the other facets nor the index were significantly influenced by the intervention. Although the effects of the quantitative data are small, the qualitative data support overall positive effects on participants\u2019 sexual experience. We discuss the content of the intervention and the methods used. Our pilot study suggests that sexual pleasure can be promoted, but that major improvements are needed to the intervention\u2019s content and design to do so effectively. Therefore, future studies are encouraged to further develop and implement such resource-efficient interventions in clinical and nonclinical samples to better understand the importance of sexual pleasure to sexual health.","tags":["randomized controlled trial","sexual health","sexual pleasure","online intervention"],"date":"2023-01-27T15:57:53.425564","doi":null,"subjects":["Sexuality","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s5cxt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s5cxt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s5cxt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s5cxt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_463"}

At present, there are only limited methods for measuring comprehension structural priming. Here, we tested whether self-paced listening (SPL, Experiments 1a-1a) and self-paced reading (SPR, Experiment 2a-2b) tasks could be an additional way to capture this phenomenon. We tested priming of temporary modifier-goal ambiguities of the form The librarian set the book on the shelf on the cushion this morning, for which comprehension priming has been demonstrated using eye-tracking (Traxler, 2008). In Experiment 1a, we found that SPL is sensitive to priming, but only under certain RT exclusion criteria. In a pre-registered replication (Experiment 1b), we used the same exclusion criteria but found no priming effect. Bayes factors support the null hypothesis in each experiment. In two variants of a self-paced reading (SPR) task (Experiment 2a-2b) using the same modifier-goal construction, we find evidence of priming only when the sentence is presented word-by-word, not when presented phrase-by-phrase. We discuss methodological recommendations for future researchers who may wish to use self-pacing tasks to measure structural priming and the theoretical implications of the absence of the priming effect in phrase-by-phrase presentation.","tags":["self-paced reading","structural priming","syntactic processing","Bayesian statistics","self-paced listening","syntactic priming"],"date":"2023-01-27T17:59:58.119098","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ytdb2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ytdb2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ytdb2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ytdb2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_465"}

An initial baseline survey was sent to a large sample of predominately older adults in Wales in December 2022 and January 2023 (n=3476) (f = 63%; white = 98%; age, M=62.94 (SD=12.83)).  Follow-up \u2018symptom surveys\u2019 are being sent to random sub-samples of the overall sample at regular intervals throughout winter 2022\/3.  Results find that intentions to get future COVID-19 vaccinations are high, but that prevalence of infection-reducing behaviours was generally low.  Additionally, although overall worry about respiratory infections was relatively low, there was greater worry about COVID-19 relative to flu and other viruses.  Amongst those experiencing symptoms, flu was perceived as the most common cause, and a high temperature, continuous cough and fever were most likely to lead people to take specific precautions like taking a COVID-19 test or seeking medical advice.  Findings have implications for public health, including the need to provide nuanced but clear public health information and guidance on what actions to take when people are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness.","tags":["Influenza","health psychology","Symptom identification","health behaviour","public health","Respiratory Illness","Non-pharmaceutical interventions","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-01-27T18:53:47.239001","doi":null,"subjects":["Prevention","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Health-related Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/92nqy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/92nqy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/92nqy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/92nqy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_466"}

This limits research generalizability, scalability, and equity in access. One solution is the development of new, remotely deployed assessment tools which don\u2019t require real-time experimenter supervision. The current nationwide (Sweden) infant twin study assessed participants remotely via their caregiver\u2019s tablets (N = 104, ages 3- to 17-months). To anchor our findings in previous research, we used a gaze following task where experimental and age effects have been well-established. Closely mimicking results from conventional eye tracking, we found that seeing a full head movement elicited more gaze following than seeing isolated eye movements. Further, as expected, we found that older infants followed gaze more frequently than younger infants. Finally, while we found no indication of genetic contributions to gaze following accuracy, latency to disengage from gaze cue and orient towards a target was significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins, indicative of heritability. Together, these results highlight the potential of remote assessment of infants\u2019 psychological development, which can improve generalizability, inclusion and scalability in developmental research.","tags":["remote assessment","twin study","infant development","eye tracking","infant cognition"],"date":"2023-01-27T19:17:41.812177","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Infancy","Perceptual Development","Cognitive Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fvbd3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/fvbd3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/fvbd3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fvbd3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_468"}

{"osf_id":"kvzt4","title":"The everyday speech environments of preschoolers with and without cochlear implants","description":"Purpose: Children with severe to profound deafness who receive cochlear implants develop speech and language on a protracted timescale, owing to the absence of auditory input pre-implantation, and the degraded speech signal transmitted by the cochlear implant post-implantation. The home environment facilitates children\u2019s speech-language development, yet it is relatively unknown how the home environment differs between children with cochlear implants and children with typical hearing. This study asked how hearing status impacts the everyday speech-language environments of preschoolers with cochlear implants, compared to their peers with typical hearing.\nMethod: Eighteen children with cochlear implants (31-65 months) were matched by chronological age and hearing age to two groups of children with typical-hearing. Each child completed a long-form, naturalistic audio recording of their home language environment (appx. 16 hrs\/child; &gt;730 hours of observation) to evaluate the impact of hearing status upon early speech-language experience: speech input from adults, child vocal productivity, and caregiver-child interaction. The quantity, consistency, and experience-related growth of each component was computed and compared across hearing groups. We additionally assessed how measures of the environment predicted the children\u2019s speech outcomes.\nResults: Unlike children with typical hearing, children with implants do not hear more speech input from caregivers as they age, and measures of the speech environment (words, interaction) do not predict their vocal outcomes as strongly. Nevertheless, all children, regardless of hearing status, engage in similar amounts of caregiver interaction. All children\u2019s own speech production matures with age, but at a much slower rate for children with implants than hearing age matched controls. All children produce more contingent speech in response to louder caregiver input.\nConclusions: Children with cochlear implants are exposed to and engage in similar amounts of language with caregivers as children with typical hearing. However, over development, the at-home speech environment does not appear to reflect developmental stages as closely for children with implants as those with typical hearing. Home-based language interventions should focus on the unique input-outcome relationships for this group of children with hearing loss.","tags":["development","speech interaction","speech production","interaction","language input","cochlear implants","acoustics","audition","speech","hearing loss","vocal development","language"],"date":"2023-01-27T20:12:45.280374","doi":null,"subjects":["Linguistics","Developmental Psychology","Toddlerhood\/Preschool Period","First and Second Language Acquisition","Phonetics and Phonology","Perceptual Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kvzt4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kvzt4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kvzt4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kvzt4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_470"}

To answer this question, one must first think of potential emotion words before choosing the best fit. However, we have little insight into how the ability to rapidly bring to mind emotion words\u2014emotion fluency\u2014relates to emotion functioning or general verbal abilities. In this study, we measured emotion fluency by counting how many emotion words participants could generate in 60s.

In pre-registered analyses, we found that participants produced more negative emotion words than positive words, and more positive words than neutral words in the emotion fluency task. As hypothesized, emotion fluency was positively related to verbal fluency, but contrary to hypotheses, emotion fluency was not related to self-reported or task-based emotion functioning (e.g., alexithymia, depression, and emotion regulation ability). As such, in community samples, emotion fluency may reflect general cognitive abilities rather than processes crucial to emotional well-being. While emotion fluency as measured here does not track indices of well-being, future research is needed to investigate potential contexts in which verbal fluency for emotion words may be key to emotion regulation.","tags":["alexithymia","depression","verbal fluency","emotion regulation","emotion fluency"],"date":"2023-01-27T20:18:51.301983","doi":"10.1037\/emo0001229","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/byhzx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/byhzx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/byhzx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/byhzx","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/emo0001229","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_471"}

These biases are often racial or ethnic in nature and create disparities and inequities across many aspects of life. Recent research has revealed that implicit biases are, for the most part, driven by social contexts and local histories. However, it has remained unclear how and if the regular ways in which human societies self-organize in cities produce systematic variation in implicit bias strength. Here we leverage extensions of the mathematical models of urban scaling theory to predict and test between-city differences in implicit racial biases. Our model comprehensively links scales of organization from city-wide infrastructure to individual psychology to quantitatively predict that cities that are (1) more populous, (2) more diverse, and (3) less segregated have lower levels of implicit biases. We find broad empirical support for each of these predictions in U.S. cities for data spanning a decade of racial implicit association tests from millions of individuals. We conclude that the organization of cities strongly drives the strength of implicit racial biases and provides potential systematic intervention targets for the development and planning of more equitable societies.","tags":["Urban Scaling Theory","Cities","Implicit Racial Bias"],"date":"2023-01-27T20:19:24.567506","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Attitudes and Persuasion","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4w5tf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4w5tf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4w5tf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4w5tf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_472"}

Investigating the mechanisms underlying training effects can help explain these inconsistencies. In this pre-registered, pre-test\/post-test online training study, we examined how training affects the quantity and quality of representations in visual WM using continuous-reproduction tasks. N = 64 young healthy adults were randomly assigned to an experimental group or an active control group to complete four training sessions to practise an orientation-reproduction task or visual search, respectively. We observed that, in the trained task, only the quality, but not the quantity, of visual WM representations significantly increased in the experimental group relative to the control group. These improvements did not generalise to untrained stimuli or paradigms. Therefore, our findings suggest that training gains are not driven by enhanced capacity. Instead, gains in the quality of visual WM representations that are tied to specific stimuli and paradigms may reflect enhanced efficiency in using the existing visual WM capacity.","tags":["quantity and quality","training mechanism","capacity and efficiency","visual work memory"],"date":"2023-01-27T20:25:03.734012","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xbkcz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xbkcz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xbkcz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xbkcz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_473"}

To test whether an instructional practice exerts a causal influence on an outcome measure, the most straightforward and compelling method is to conduct an experiment. While experimentation is common in laboratory studies of learning, experimentation is increasingly rare in classroom settings, and to date, researchers have argued it is prohibitively expensive and difficult to conduct experiments on education in situ. To address this challenge, we present Terracotta (Tool for Education Research with RAndomized COnTrolled TriAls), an open-source web application that integrates with a learning management system to provide a comprehensive experimental research platform within an online class site. Terracotta automates randomization, informed consent, experimental manipulation of different versions of learning activities, and export of de-identified research data.  Here we describe these features, and the results of a live classroom demonstration study using Terracotta, a preregistered replication of McDaniel, Wildman, and Anderson (2012).  Using Terracotta, we experimentally manipulated online review assignments so that consenting students alternated, on a weekly basis, between taking multiple-choice quizzes (retrieval practice) and reading answers to these quizzes (restudy).  Students' performance on subsequent exams was significantly improved for items that had been in retrieval practice review assignments.  This successful replication demonstrates that Terracotta can be used to experimentally manipulate consequential aspects of students\u2019 experiences in education settings.","tags":["learning management system","education","student learning","experiments"],"date":"2023-01-27T21:52:00.878230","doi":null,"subjects":["Educational Psychology","Learning","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Experimental Design and Sample Surveys","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ktavq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ktavq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ktavq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ktavq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_475"}

Ten research assistants (working independently, and without prior training in assessment) used prototype descriptions of the triarchic traits to rate 40 participants on each trait. Their ratings correlated meaningfully with a range of relevant self-reported traits. Thus, aspects of psychopathy could be detected, albeit imperfectly, solely from written autobiographical memories.

The controversy surrounding the unit of VWM often centers on the representation of objects consist of same dimensional features (e.g., bicolor objects). For two colors in a bicolor object, some behavioral studies have suggested that they need to be represented by separate units, while some other studies using electrophysiological measures have found that they can be represented within a single unit. In an effort to resolve this apparent conflict, the current study hypothesized that there might be two dissociable units of VWM: the unit of control (object) and the unit of storage (Boolean map). Adopting the contralateral delay activity (CDA) as an electrophysiological marker of VWM, Experiments 1 and 2 consistently found that the CDA amplitude for memorizing bicolor circles at P7\/P8 was sensitive to the number of Boolean maps, while the CDA amplitude at P3\/P4 relied on the number of objects.

{"osf_id":"juq3b","title":"Psychotropic drugs and the environment: a comprehensive analysis of surface water concentrations and associated risks","description":"Key Points\nQuestion: Do psychotropic drug concentrations in surface water pose a risk for the environment?\nFindings: In this in-depth study examining over a thousand water samples collected across the Netherlands we found that surface water concentrations of oxazepam and carbamazepine are above acceptable limits in some locations. Households were estimated to be the largest contributor, even in an area with a large community hospital.\nMeaning: To ensure safe wildlife habitats and prevent further decline of vulnerable species, reducing surface water concentrations of psychotropic drugs is needed. This likely requires changes in waste management as well as in prescription and use behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2003\nAbstract\nImportance: For most countries it is currently unknown to what degree concentrations of psychotropic drugs in surface water exceed environmental threshold concentrations (ETCs) for ecosystems and what risk mitigation could be applied. ETCs are defined as per-compound threshold concentrations above which detrimental effects on reproduction, growth, and mortality of aquatic organisms cannot be excluded.\nObjective: To quantify concentrations of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines in surface water, investigate their sources and assess whether these levels exceed ETCs. \nDesign: Cross-sectional analysis of measured and modeled data. Environmental levels were compared to ETCs to evaluate their risks for the aquatic environment. Finally, sources of psychotropic drugs were investigated. \nSetting: All available Dutch water monitoring data from all regional and national monitoring campaigns of 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExposures: Concentrations of aripiprazole, carbamazepine and its metabolites, clozapine, diazepam, (es)citalopram, fluoxetine, haloperidol, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oxazepam, temazepam, quetiapine, sertraline, valproic acid, and venlafaxine. \nMain outcomes and measures: The main outcomes were measured and modeled concentrations of the aforementioned agents in surface water. As a secondary outcome, where possible, average risk quotients (RQs) were calculated by dividing the measured or modeled concentrations by the ETC. An RQ &gt; 1 was interpreted as a risk to the environment.\nResults: Psychotropic drug samples (n=1201; 14-520 measurements per drug) showed the highest average concentrations for oxazepam (0.91 \u00b5g\/L; RQ = 1.89) and carbamazepine (0.74 \u00b5g\/L; RQ = 1.48), with individual measurements exceeding ETCs. For other drugs, measured concentrations did not reach the detection limit (amisulpride, (es)citalopram, quetiapine, and venlafaxine) or did not exceed the ETC (fluoxetine). Furthermore, households contributed most to psychotropics in surface water. Finally, psychotropics were cleared less efficiently from a wastewater treatment plant than other medications.\nConclusions and Relevance: Psychotropic drugs are present in surface water, are primarily emitted by households, and may put organisms at risk. We signal a need to reduce concentrations of several psychotropic agents in the environment. Our findings set the stage for policies and research aimed at curtailing emissions of psychotropic drugs into the environment and highlight a need for responsible prescribing and waste measures.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-28T15:50:17.809742","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/juq3b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/juq3b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/juq3b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/juq3b","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_479"}

The current research explored fluctuations within and between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism in daily life. We investigated whether individuals\u2019 levels of grandiosity and vulnerability (i) vary, (ii) are instable, and (iii) display inertia and cross-lagged effects in their daily narcissistic expressions. Participants (N = 253; Mage= 22, 85% female) completed grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic trait questionnaires. Using ecological momentary assessment, they further completed up to 60 grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic state questionnaires over six days. Results showed that higher grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits led to more within-person variability within their corresponding states. Additionally, higher grandiose leadership\/authority and exploitativeness\/entitlement traits related to greater vulnerable within-person variability, while self-absorption\/self-admiration reduced this. Similarly, all narcissistic traits, except for exploitativeness\/entitlement, were positively related to increased instability in their corresponding state. Further, both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic states demonstrated significant inertia, i.e., lingering narcissistic endorsements within their own states. Overall, the results showed that grandiosity and vulnerability include time-variant states that are intertwined and need to be acknowledged as additional moving, dimensional constructs.","tags":["ESM","narcissism","fluctuations","EMA"],"date":"2023-01-28T20:20:37.210871","doi":null,"subjects":["Personality Processes","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Individual Differences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x3fqj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x3fqj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x3fqj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x3fqj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_480"}

In order to disentangle the contribution of culture and psychoacoustics, we considered automatic responses to the perfect fifth and the major second (flattened by 25 cents) intervals alongside conscious evaluations of the same intervals across two cultures and two levels of musical expertise. Four groups of participants completed the tasks: expert performers of Lithuanian Sutartines, English speaking musicians in Western diatonic genres, Lithuanian non-musicians and English-speaking non-musicians. Sutartines singers were chosen as this style of singing is an example of 'beat diaphony' where intervals of parts form predominantly rough sonorities and audible beats. There was no difference in automatic responses to intervals, suggesting that an aversion to acoustically rough intervals is not governed by cultural familiarity but may have a physical basis in how the human auditory system works. However, conscious evaluations resulted in group differences with Sutartines singers rating both the flattened major as more positive than did other groups.

Specifically, exposure to community and individual level stressors during adolescence has been reported to be associated with increased substance use. However, it remains unclear what the relative contribution of different community and individual level factors play when alcohol and marijuana use begin to peak in adolescence. The present study uses a large longitudinal sample of adolescents (Wave 1: N = 2,017; 55% Female; 54.5% White, 22.3% Black, 8% Hispanic, 15% other) to evaluate the association between community and individual level factors and substance use during the transitional window from adolescence to young adulthood (e.g., 15-21-years-old). Across three waves of data, multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to evaluate the association between community affluence and disadvantage, individual household socioeconomic status [SES], self-reported public assistance, and self-reported childhood trauma with self-reported 12-month alcohol and 12-month marijuana use. We accounted for sample-selection weights and attrition-adjusted weights in modeling to evaluate the robustness of the estimated effects. Across the MLMs, there was a significant positive association between community affluence and household SES with self-reported alcohol use. In post hoc analyses, higher neighborhood affluence in older adolescents was associated with higher alcohol use and lower use in younger adolescents; the opposite association was found for neighborhood disadvantage. Meanwhile, self-reported child trauma had a significant positive association with both12-month alcohol and 12-month marijuana use. Results were largely consistent across weighted and unweighted analyses. This study demonstrates a nuanced relationship between community and individual level adversities and substance use during the transitional window of adolescence that should be considered when contextualizing substance use during adolescence.","tags":["neighborhood affluence","marijuana use","adolescence","geographic information systems","childhood maltreatment","alcohol use","young adult","neighborhood disadvantage"],"date":"2023-01-28T22:00:27.525091","doi":null,"subjects":["Adolescence","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/p762n\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/p762n\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/p762n","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/p762n","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_482"}

They present diagnostic challenges and limited options for treatment, and highlight the urgent need for a more thorough understanding of how human consciousness arises from coordinated neural activity. The increasing availability of multimodal neuroimaging data has given rise to a wide range of clinically- and scientifically-motivated modelling efforts, seeking to improve data-driven stratification of patients, to identify causal mechanisms for patient pathophysiology and loss of consciousness more broadly, and to develop simulations as a means of testing in silico potential treatment avenues to restore consciousness. As a dedicated Working Group of clinicians and neuroscientists of the international Curing Coma Campaign, here we provide our framework and vision to understand the diverse statistical and generative computational modelling approaches that are being employed in this fast-growing field. We identify the gaps that exist between the current state of the art in statistical and biophysical computational modelling in human neuroscience, and the aspirational goal of a mature field of modelling disorders of consciousness; which might drive improved treatments and outcomes in the clinic. Finally, we make several recommendations for how the field as a whole can work together to address these challenges.","tags":["machine learning","computational models","digital twins","biophysical models","statistical models","Disorders of consciousness","generative models"],"date":"2023-01-29T03:44:05.282259","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5dp3j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5dp3j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5dp3j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5dp3j","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_483"}

However, existing findings on perception of social interactive stimuli were still largely inconclusive. Here, we adopted an ecologically valid interactive-dyads paradigm to further investigate this unsolved issue. As previous studies found healthy individuals showed faster in searching for a social interactive target (face-to-face agent) than non-social interactive one (back-to-back agent), here we tested whether patients with schizophrenia (PSZ) could comparably benefit from social interactive information as healthy control subjects (HCS). Thirty-five PSZ and thirty-five HCS participated in a visual search task. During the task, they were required to find a face-to-face target (Facing condition) or a back-to-back target (Non-facing condition) along with other three distractors (two agents facing in the same direction) as accurately and quickly as possible. Participants in both groups showed significantly faster response time in finding the social interactive target (face-to-face) in comparison with non-interactive one (back-to-back). Interestingly, such an advantage of searching for social interactive stimuli was intact in medicated stable PSZ, and the searching benefit was comparable, if not larger, to HCS. The current study suggests that PSZ with stable medication regimen were able to use the social interactive information effectively to facilitate their visual search performance, which has significant implications in expanding our understanding of the interactive aspect of social perception in schizophrenia.","tags":["social perception","schizophrenia","social interaction","visual search"],"date":"2023-01-29T09:25:57.840920","doi":null,"subjects":["Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gct6y\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gct6y\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gct6y","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gct6y","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_485"}

Learning to adapt in a multi-context predictive inference task.","description":"Predictive inference is an important cognitive function and there are many tasks which measure it, and the error driven learning that underpins it. Context is a key contribution to this learning, with different contexts requiring different learning strategies. A factor not often considered however, is the conditions and time-frame over which a model of that context is developed. This study required participants to learn under two changing, unsignalled contexts with opposing optimal responses to large errors - change-points and oddballs. The changes in context occurred under two task structures: 1) a fixed task structure, with consecutive, short blocks of each context, and 2) a random task structure, with the context randomly selected for each new block. Through this design we examined the conditions under which learning contexts can be differentiated from each other, and the time-frame over which that learning occurs. We found that participants responded in accordance with the optimal strategy for each contexts, and did so within a short period of time, over very few meaningful errors. We further found that the responses became more optimal throughout the experiment, but only for periods of context consistency (the fixed task structure), and if the first experienced context involved meaningful errors. These results show that people will continue to refine their model of the environment across multiple trials and blocks, leading to more context-appropriate responding - but only in certain conditions. This highlights the importance of considering the task structure, and the time-frames of model development those patterns may encourage.

Two versions of the Cybersickness in VR Questionnaire (CSQ-VR), a paper-and-pencil and a 3D \u2013VR version, were developed. Validation and comparison of CSQ-VR against SSQ and VRSQ were performed. Thir-ty-nine participants were exposed to 3 rides with linear and angular accelerations in VR. Assess-ments of cognitive and psychomotor skills were performed at baseline and after each ride. The va-lidity of both versions of CSQ_VR was confirmed. Notably, CSQ-VR demonstrated substantially better internal consistency than both SSQ and VRSQ. Also, CSQ-VR scores had significantly better psychometric properties in detecting a temporary decline in performance due to cybersickness. Pupil size was a significant predictor of cybersickness intensity. In conclusion, the CSQ-VR is a valid assessment of cybersickness, with superior psychometric properties to SSQ and VRSQ.

Such research initially focused on the biological evolution of the capacities to create and perceive language and music; later work has been increasingly tackling the cultural evolution angle to study the mechanisms and processes driving the diversity and regularities of music and language. In this chapter, we review seminal studies of the cultural evolution of music and language. We group the review into observational studies (e.g., phylogenetic analysis), experimental studies (e.g., transmission chains), simulation studies (e.g., agent-based models), and music-language relationships (e.g., song\/speech melody\/prosody). Furthermore, we highlight key ideas that each discipline can learn from the other and promising research topics to encourage collaborative work. In particular, we argue that more direct comparisons of music and language will help to better understand commonalities and differences in their evolution. This includes parallels (or lack thereof) in cognitive and motor constraints (e.g., memorability, ease of vocalization), cultural transmission mechanisms (e.g., vertical\/horizontal transmission with\/independent from human populations), and underlying biological bases (e.g., vocal learning).

However, electrical stimulation introduces significant electromagnetic interference into the EEG signal that can mask underlying brain dynamics.\nWhether established signal processing methods can allow for a reduction of said interference whilst retaining effects of interest, remains unexplored. We addressed these questions focusing on the classic N170 visual evoked potential, a face-sensitive brain component: 20 participants viewed images of houses, and of sad, happy, and neutral faces, whilst performing an irrelevant target detection task. On half of the trials, fNMES was delivered for 500 milliseconds to bilateral lower-face muscles during the presentation of visual stimuli. As expected, a larger N170 amplitude was found for faces relative to houses.

In 1993\/94 and again in 1995, 40 female undergraduates in the U.K. were asked about foods they avoided and their reasons for and any changes in this avoidance.  Most (29 out of 40) of these students maintained the same pattern of avoidance for 18-24 months, although about 66% (19 out of 29) of them changed their primary reason for not eating flesh.  Also, most (8 out of 11) of those students who had changed their pattern of avoidance reported a different motive.  Those women who became less strict (n = 8) accepted more poultry and\/or fish or even beef or lamb.  Only 3 students became stricter in their avoidance of animal species.  Some students ate more variedly at home, because of more money and time, but also to conform to the family\u2019s eating patterns.  Most family members and friends (meat eaters) responded favourably to those who became less strict.  However, more extreme peers (vegetarians) reacted negatively.  Thus, although meat avoidance was sustained by many for at least 18 months, the range of avoidance and its reasons varied over time and with context.","tags":["Plant food choices","Meat avoidance","Vegetarianism","Young women's food choices","Cohort study","Food choice","Eating motivation","Reasons for meat avoidance","Food habits","Changes in vegetarian habits"],"date":"2023-01-30T09:46:36.454736","doi":null,"subjects":["Consumer Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Health-related Behavior","Health Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x8wez\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x8wez\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x8wez","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x8wez","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_494"}

Results of neuroimaging studies focusing on the amygdala are, however, often heterogeneous since it is composed of functionally and neuroanatomically distinct subnuclei. Fortunately, ultra-high-field imaging offers several advances for amygdala research, most importantly more accurate representation of functional and structural properties of subnuclei and their connectivity. Most clinical studies using ultra-high-field imaging focused on major depression, suggesting either overall rightward amygdala atrophy or distinct bilateral patterns of subnuclear atrophy and hypertrophy. Other pathologies are only sparsely covered. Connectivity analyses identified widespread networks for learning and memory, stimulus processing, cognition, and social processes. They provide evidence for distinct roles of the central, basal, and basolateral nucleus, and the extended amygdala in fear and emotion processing. Amid largely sparse and ambiguous evidence, we propose theoretical and methodological considerations that will guide ultra-high-field imaging in comprehensive investigations to help disentangle the ambiguity of the amygdala\u2019s function, structure, connectivity, and clinical relevance.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-30T10:34:43.374877","doi":null,"subjects":["Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Clinical Neuroscience","Psychiatry","Behavioral Neuroscience","Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yj5uv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yj5uv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yj5uv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yj5uv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_496"}

Individuals have to coordinate their actions with great precision to achieve the such smooth and rapid turn-transitions observed in naturalistic interactions. For this, participants need to predict turn completions, estimate their duration, and initiate a response well before the end of an ongoing turn. In this study we evaluate whether cognitively able autistic individuals have difficulties with a turn-ends identification task. \nMethods: Autistic participants and an age-, gender-, schooling- and general cognitive abilities- matched control sample listened to turns, extracted from the recordings of natural conversations, which were selected to have predictable vs. unpredictable endings.\nResults: Both groups responded faster for predictable turns, however, there was a main effect for group; autistic participants were significantly slower to respond overall. \nConclusions: Results indicate that in ASD the linguistic and semantic prediction component seems preserved, whereas other processes, e.g. initiation of a response or precise timing might cause the delay.","tags":["response initiation","timing","autism spectrum disorder","prediction","semantic memory","turn-taking"],"date":"2023-01-30T10:38:32.785461","doi":null,"subjects":["Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/42e6j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/42e6j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/42e6j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/42e6j","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_497"}

Models such as the Theory of Planned Behavior have been widely used to explain primarily individual private-sphere pro-environmental behaviors (PEB). However, as shared mobility behaviors are not completely limited to the private-sphere, but require social collaboration, it is an open question if the TPB-variables are sufficient in explaining shared mobility behaviors. Solidarity-focused variables that put a stronger focus on social interactions may complement the TPB-variables meaningfully. In two university samples (Study 1: N = 261, Study 2: N = 1411), we tested associations between the TPB-variables and shared mobility behavioral intention using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Both studies confirmed attitude and social norms as significant predictors. However, perceived behavioral control was not related to shared mobility intention. Study 2 additionally investigated whether social responsibility, collective response efficacy and social identity are related to shared mobility. Results showed that social responsibility as well as collective response efficacy positively predicted shared mobility intention. In Logistic regressions, the psychological variables showed no consistent connections to self-reported shared mobility behavior. We discuss the scope of solidarity-oriented variables to complementarily explain PEB beyond the private-sphere that need social collaboration.","tags":[],"date":"2023-01-30T11:38:51.417701","doi":null,"subjects":["Sustainability Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qemv6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qemv6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qemv6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qemv6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_498"}

These findings were taken as evidence that visual statistical learning might be implicated in morphological processing during visual word recognition. The present study seeks to specify this claim by (a) establishing the visual, language-agnostic nature of the underlying learning mechanism and (b) examining it in the presence of higher-order linguistic information. In Experiments 1a and 1b, readers were familiarized with strings of abstract shapes that involved affix-like chunks of frequently co-occurring shapes. We found that readers were sensitive to the presence and position of chunks. Further experiments revealed that presence and position effects were stronger when readers were exposed to letter strings which allowed access to orthographic and phonological representations (Experiments 2a and 2b), and were enhanced by access to semantics (Experiment 3). Our study demonstrates that the learning of visual regularities supports chunk identification both in purely visual and language-like materials, and that the availability of linguistic information enhances this learning.

One reason is that the cognitive models used in this area need known cues and cue values. This limitation makes it difficult to apply the models to research questions with complex naturalistic stimuli with unknown cue strucuture. In two studies, building on early categorizaton research, we demonstrate how cues and cue values of complex naturalistic stimuli can be extracted from pairwise similarity ratings with a multidimensional scaling analysis and then be used in a state-of-the art hierarchical Bayesian model of numerical judgments. In the first study, we show that predefined cue structures of artificial stimuli are well recovered by a MDS analysis of similarity judgments and that using these MDS-based attributes as cues in a cognitive model of judgment data from an existing experiment leads to the same inferences as when the original cue values were used. In the second study, we use the same procedure to replicate previous findings from multiple-cue judgment literature using complex naturalistic stimuli.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-01T08:46:53.140886","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3avwk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3avwk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3avwk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3avwk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_500"}

The present study examined how discovering that a confidently held misconception is incorrect influences emotions and in turn the motivation to seek additional information. We asked 275 preservice teachers to judge if common statements about education were true or false and provided feedback about whether these statements were supported by scientific evidence. Following feedback, we assessed study participants\u2019 real-time (i.e., state-level) epistemic emotions (surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, frustration, anxiety) and achievement emotions (anger, pride) produced by high-confidence errors (i.e., incorrect answers a person was confident in). We further examined whether providing additional information helped participants to resolve their discrepancy and to what extent emotions promoted participants\u2019 subsequent knowledge exploration. Our findings showed that participants were more surprised, curious, confused and angry in situations they found out a confidently held misconception was incorrect (i.e., after a high-confidence error) compared to misconceptions held with low confidence. Furthermore, participants reported more enjoyment in situations where they could resolve the discrepancy, and they were frustrated when resolution of a discrepancy seemed impossible. In contrast to achievement-related anger and pride, participants\u2019 surprise, curiosity, confusion and anxiety was associated with the exploration of knowledge. Finally, we tested whether the intra-individual effects would differ across individuals, but we found no evidence for such inter-individual differences.

We developed an online version of EPELI 3D videogame for naturalistic and scalable assessment of goal-directed action and prospective memory in adult ADHD. In EPELI, participants perform instructed everyday chores in a virtual apartment from memory.  Our pre-registered hypothesis predicted weaker EPELI performances in adult ADHD compared to controls. The sample comprised 112 adults with ADHD and 255 neurotypical controls comparable in age (mean 31, SD = 8 years), gender distribution (71% females) and educational level. Using web-browser, the participants performed EPELI and other cognitive tasks, including Conner\u2019s Continuous Performance Test (CPT). They also filled out questionnaires probing everyday executive performance and kept a five-day diary of everyday prospective memory errors. Self-reported strategy use in the EPELI game was also examined. The ADHD participants\u2019 self-ratings indicated clearly more everyday executive problems than in the controls.

{"osf_id":"u53zv","title":"Influencing dreams through sensory stimulation: a systematic review","description":"Sleep is commonly regarded as a state of disconnection from the environment. Yet, instances of external sensory stimuli affecting the course of dreams have been reported for centuries. Importantly, understanding the impact of external stimuli on dreams could shed light on the origin and generation of dreams, the functional mechanisms that preserve sleep continuity, and the processes that underlie conscious awareness. Moreover, the possibility of using sensory stimuli for dream engineering could potentially benefit patients suffering from alterations in the intensity or content of sleep conscious experiences. Here, we performed a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the robustness of the current evidence regarding the influence of external sensory stimulation during sleep on dreams experiences. In a literature search using PsycNET, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, we selected any experimental work presenting dream data obtained from a confirmed sleep episode during which visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or somatosensory stimulation was administered. A methodological assessment of the included studies was performed using an adapted version of the Downs and Black\u2019s (1998) checklist. Fifty-one publications met the inclusion criteria, of which 21 reported data related to auditory stimulation, 10 to somatosensory stimulation, 8 to olfactory stimulation, 4 to visual stimulation, 2 to vestibular stimulation, and 1 to multi-modal stimulation (audio-visual). Furthermore, 9 references involved pre-conditioned associative stimulation procedures: 6 relied on targeted memory reactivation protocols and 3 on targeted lucid reactivation protocols. The reported frequency of stimulus-dependent dream changes across studies ranged from 0% to ~90%. Such a variability likely reflects the considerable heterogeneity of experimental and methodological approaches. Overall, the literature analysis identified a lack of substantial understanding of the key mechanisms, functions, and correlates of stimulus-dependent dream changes. We believe that a paradigm shift is required for meaningful and significant advancement in the field. We hope that this review will serve as a starting point for such a shift.","tags":["sensory-dependent dream changes","sensory stimulation","incorporation","dream","sleep","systematic review","modulation"],"date":"2023-02-01T14:33:08.436280","doi":null,"subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u53zv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/u53zv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/u53zv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u53zv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_506"}

{"osf_id":"y43e6","title":"Target detection does not influence temporal memory","description":"Target detection has been found to enhance memory for concurrently presented stimuli under dual-task conditions. This \u201cattentional boost effect\u201d is reminiscent of findings in the event memory literature, where conditions giving rise to event boundaries have been shown to enhance memory for boundary items. Target detection commonly requires a working memory update (e.g., adding to a covert mental target count), which is also thought to be a key contributor to creating event boundaries. However, whether target detection impacts temporal memory in similar ways as event boundaries remains unknown, because these two parallel literatures have used different types of memory tests, making direct comparisons difficult. In a pre-registered experiment with sequential Bayes factor design, we examined whether target detection influences temporal binding between items by inserting target and non-target stimuli during encoding of trial-unique object images, then comparing subsequent temporal order and distance memory for image pairs that span a target or non-target. We found that target detection enhanced recognition memory for target trial images but had no effect on temporal binding between items. In a follow-up experiment, we showed that when the encoding task required updating of task set rather than target count, event segmentation-related temporal memory effects were observed. These results document that target detection as such does not disrupt inter-item associations in memory, and that attention orienting in the absence of updating task sets does not create event boundaries. This suggests a key distinction between declarative and procedural working memory updates in segmenting events in memory.","tags":["Event boundaries","Attentional Boost Effect","Attention and memory"],"date":"2023-02-01T15:44:21.178925","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/y43e6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/y43e6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/y43e6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/y43e6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_509"}
{"osf_id":"tkub9","title":"A Functional Approach to Borderline Personality Disorder","description":"Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can be considered the most effective treatment when attending to problem behaviors that define borderline personality disorder (BPD). This therapy employs chain analysis as the tool for accounting for contextual variables that maintain these behaviors. However, these detected variables are descriptive and temporal rather than strictly functional. That is, the role of contextual variables is analyzed regarding temporal relations with the problem behavior, but not in terms of contingency relations that allow showing their function. Thus, a functional approach to hypothesize these contingency relations between responses and the variables that control them was carried out. Behavior functional analysis was employed as a tool and functional hypotheses of the DSM-5-TR criteria for BPD were conducted. The conclusion is that the proposed approach can be used as a guide to elaborate functional hypotheses about cases displaying the behaviors defined in the diagnosis.","tags":["functionaly analysis","chain analysis","borderline personality disorder","functional hypothesis","dialectical behavior therpy"],"date":"2023-02-01T15:50:20.141310","doi":null,"subjects":["Assessment","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Personality Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tkub9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tkub9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tkub9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tkub9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_510"}
{"osf_id":"64udy","title":"Access to inner language enhances memory for events","description":"Events are temporally-bounded experiences involving people, objects and actions that can be segmented into sequences of smaller meaningful events (e.g., the steps involved in constructing a piece of furniture), but the role of inner language in remembering such events has been unclear. We investigated whether inner language enhances memory for events in a naturalistic, non-verbal task where participants constructed simple models from memory. Across three experiments, we used linguistic suppression in a dual-task paradigm to test whether inner language improved overall memory performance and completion time, additionally exploring the number of events that could be recalled. We found that access to inner language at encoding consistently affected memory performance: when inner language was disrupted at encoding, participants were poorer at recalling the models and remembered fewer events. This effect was present whether or not the number of events to be recalled exceed event memory capacity (estimated to be approximately 7-8 events). Critically, the effect of linguistic suppression on memory performance was greater than a control secondary task that did not affect access to language; that is, poorer performance was not solely due to dual-task effects. The results support the proposal that inner language enhances event memory via a mechanism of linguistic bootstrapping, which in turn extends theories of event memory and adds to a growing body of evidence that inner language is a highly valuable cognitive tool.","tags":["event cognition","linguistic suppression","event memory","linguistic bootstrapping","inner language"],"date":"2023-02-01T16:13:37.042852","doi":null,"subjects":["Concepts and Categories","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/64udy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/64udy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/64udy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/64udy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_511"}

Here, we test the prediction that specific types of momentary emotional experiences are differently linked to psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. Study 1 used survey data collected from 24,221 participants in 51 countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that, across countries, wellbeing is linked to individuals\u2019 recent emotional experiences, including calm, hope, anxiety, loneliness, and sadness. Consistent results are found in two age, sex, and ethnicity-representative samples in the United Kingdom (N = 971) and the United States (N=961) with pre-registered analyses (Study 2). A prospective 30-day daily diary study conducted in the United Kingdom (N = 110) confirms the key role of these five emotions, and demonstrates that emotional experiences precede changes in wellbeing (Study 3). Our findings highlight differential relationships between specific types of momentary emotional experiences and wellbeing, and point to the cultivation of calm and hope as candidate routes for wellbeing interventions during periods of sustained stress.","tags":["emotion","COVID-19 pandemic","wellbeing","stress"],"date":"2023-02-01T16:33:35.773467","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/edkbq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/edkbq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/edkbq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/edkbq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_512"}

They seemingly fail to recognize, for instance, that only the direct causes of an event can affect its probability (the Markov condition). How can one explain this paradox? Here we argue that standard normative analyses of causal reasoning mostly apply to the idealized case where the reasoner has perfect confidence in her knowledge of the underlying causal model. Given uncertainty about the correct representation of a causal system, it is not always rational for a reasoner to respect the Markov condition and other \u2018normative\u2019 principles. To test whether uncertainty can account for the apparent fallibility of human judgments, we formulate a simple computational model of a rational-but-uncertain causal reasoner. In a re-analysis of a recent causal reasoning study, the model fits the data significantly better than its standard normative counterpart.","tags":["Computational modeling","Markov violations","Causal reasoning","Inference judgments"],"date":"2023-02-01T17:30:35.442222","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Reasoning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pf9sq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pf9sq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pf9sq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pf9sq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_513"}

However, limited information exists on psychology training opportunities in critical care settings. We aim to identify and describe (1) existing psychology programs with training in critical care settings and (2) barriers to finding these training opportunities. Research Method\/Design: Using aspects of the Arksey and O\u2019Malley Framework and PRISMA-ScR reporting checklist as a guide, two independent reviewers searched the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) Directory and Universal Psychology Postdoctoral Directory (UPPD) to identify programs with training experiences in critical care settings. Results: Searching the APPIC Directory did not reliably or accurately identify training opportunities in critical care settings for pre-doctoral interns. After duplicates were removed, searches using the UPPD yielded 31 programs for review. Of those, 22 programs met inclusion, offering heterogenous training, in critical care settings.\nConclusions\/Implications: These results suggest few opportunities for training in critical care settings exist and that they are hard to find using standard search methods. The identified challenges also emphasize the need for advanced search features for training opportunities within APPIC\/UPPD and\/or a list of programs offering these training opportunities.

However, there is little evaluation about whether these trainings are effective at changing officers' beliefs, motivations, and actions. To examine their efficacy, we tested a daylong implicit bias-oriented diversity training that sought to increase U.S. police officers' knowledge of biases, concerns about bias, and use of evidence-based strategies to mitigate bias (total N = 3,764). Relative to baseline, the training was immediately effective at increasing knowledge about bias, concerns about bias, and intentions to address bias. However, the effects were fleeting. Although the training was linked to higher knowledge for at least one month, it was ineffective at durably increasing concerns or strategy use. These findings suggest that diversity trainings as they are currently practiced are unlikely to change police behavior.

In our study, participants solved mazes that differed systematically in topological properties regulating the number of alternatives and depth of paths.

{"osf_id":"6utdj","title":"Population-level transitions in observed difficulties through childhood and adolescence","description":"In an attempt to better characterise the complexity of difficulties observed within developing populations, numerous data-driven techniques have been applied to large, mixed datasets. However, many have failed to incorporate the core role of developmental time in these approaches. That is, the typical course of change in behavioural features that occurs over childhood to adolescence. In this study, we utilised manifold projections alongside a gradient boosting model on data collected from the Millennium Cohort Study to unpack the central role developmental time in how behavioural difficulties transition between the ages of 5, 11 and 17. Our analysis highlights numerous observations: (i) girls develop relatively greater internalised behavioural problems during adolescence, (ii) in the case of a chaotic home environment, co-occurring internalizing and externalizing difficulties tend to persist during childhood, (iii) peer problems were the most likely to persist over the whole 12 year-period (especially in the presence of early maternal depression and poor family relationships), and (iv) there were two pathways with distinct risk factors leading to antisocial behaviours in adolescence \u2013 an early childhood-onset pathway and later adolescent-onset pathway. Our findings provide evidence that investigations of child and adolescent difficulties must be open to the possibility of multiple sub-groups, and variability in trajectory over time. We further highlight the crucial role of family and social support, and school experience-related factors, in predicting children\u2019s outcomes.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-02T11:29:03.665215","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6utdj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6utdj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6utdj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6utdj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_529"}

However, previous ambulatory assessment (AA) studies that examined NSSI found mixed results. We investigated the affect regulation function of NSSI in 51 women with DSM-5 NSSI disorder in a 15-day AA study with five random daily prompts and self-initiated NSSI prompts. We extend previous work by i) comparing NSSI moments to moments of a high-urge for NSSI, ii) adding high-frequency sampling following NSSI and high-urge moments, and iii) including tension as a dependent variable. We hypothesized that NA and tension would show a steeper decrease following NSSI than following high-urge moments, if NSSI was effective in reducing NA and tension. Results showed that the significant linear NA decline following NSSI was not steeper than that following high-urge moments. For aversive tension, we found that NSSI was associated with a significant linear decrease in tension, whereas resisting an urge was not. High-urge moments were better described by an inverted U-shaped pattern, likewise leading to decreased NA and tension following the reported urge. In exploratory analyses, we provide visualized clustering of the NA and tension trajectories surrounding NSSI using k-means and relate these to participants\u2019 self-rated effectiveness of the NSSI events. Findings indicate that resisting an urge may also be effective in managing NA and tension and underline the utility of interventions such as urge-surfing.","tags":["Non-suicidal self-injury","ambulatory assessment","affect","tension","emotion regulation"],"date":"2023-02-02T11:51:21.328536","doi":"10.1016\/j.brat.2023.104273","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pqmeb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pqmeb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pqmeb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pqmeb","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.brat.2023.104273","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_531"}

The deviations from the actual to the forecasted sales, which simulate the development without the emergence of COVID-19, yield estimates for the pandemic\u2019s impact. In 36 of the 47 countries and regions, the actual sales in 2020 were lower than predicted, with an average relative drop of 6.23% in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day at country-level. In 2021, most countries recorded actually higher ADHD medication use than predicted at the end of 2019. On average, the consumption increased per country by 1.60%.

Shaping Healthy Minds is a modular intervention which synthesises several evidence-based treatment techniques, allowing for standardised, yet flexible, treatment delivery. We conducted a patient-level two-arm randomised controlled trial (HARMONIC) that compared Shaping Healthy Minds to psychological treatment-as-usual (PTAU) for individuals aged &gt;18 years (n = 42). Participants met criteria for at least two comorbid mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or trauma\/stressor disorder diagnoses and were recruited from outpatient psychological services within the UK National Health Service (NHS). This early phase trial aimed to estimate the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of the transdiagnostic intervention. We obtained estimates of likely effect size and acquired basic demographic, cognitive and behavioural data to assess potential mediators and moderators of outcome in preparation for a later phase fully-powered efficacy trial. Co-primary outcomes were self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, disability and functional impairment; and the trial provided point estimates of efficacy for Shaping Healthy Minds versus Psychological TAU with moderate effect sizes in favour of Shaping Healthy Minds at post-treatment (Cohen\u2019s d estimates ranging from 0.60-0.92) and at 3-month follow-up (Cohen\u2019s d 0.41-0.48).  Secondary outcomes included number of diagnoses and changes in transdiagnostic processes. The project has demonstrated that a full trial is feasible, and that the Shaping Healthy Minds treatment approach appears likely to be efficacious compared to PTAU. The trial procedures were approved by the Health Research Authority of the NHS of the UK (East of England, Reference: 16\/EE\/0095).

Drawing from research on the relationship between personality and real-world migration intentions, we aimed to compare whether the Big Five personality traits similarly (or differently) predict willingness to move to the metaverse and to geographical places. We conducted two representative studies (Ntotal =2306) in Poland. We found that extraversion positively and agreeableness and conscientiousness negatively predict virtual and real-world migration willingness. Furthermore, openness is positively associated with real-world migration intentions and negatively associated with willingness to migrate to the metaverse.

While ample evidence indicates that non-specific arousal can indeed be caused by unconscious threatening stimuli, data regarding the involvement of the attentional selection mechanism remains inconclusive. Therefore, in the present study we used ERPs to compare the potential engagement of attention in the perception of subliminal and supraliminal fearful facial expressions to that of neutral ones. In the conscious condition, fearful faces were preferentially encoded (as indicated by the N170 component) and prioritized by bottom-up (EPN) and spatial attention (N2pc) in an automatic, task-independent manner. Furthermore consciously perceived fearful expressions engaged cognitive resources (SPCN, P3) when face stimuli were task-relevant. In the unconscious condition fearful faces were still preferentially encoded (N170), but we found no evidence for any type of attentional prioritization.

This paper considers a variety of growth curve and related models based on those presented in Wood, Steinley &amp; Jackson (2015). Two general multi-group growth models are considered: Growth models, in which only factor means are responsible for mean level of observed variables, and reference growth models, in which common manifest variable intercepts across groups are estimated as well. An analogous variety of latent class growth models are also considered. Right-sizing of mixture models consists of an initial assessment of the dimensionality of the series and a grid search of candidate growth models to determine the number of latent classes for the best fitting structural model. If the final solution of the best-fitting mixture model appears to warrant it, more parsimonious parametric growth models of functional form over time can be considered as well. The process is first successfully illustrated using simulated data sets to illustrate recovery of both pure and reference growth models and to illustrate the likely artifactual mixtures identified by traditional models. A simulation data set is also conducted to identify linear slope intercept models with varying linear basis functions. Finally, analysis of a real-world data set is used to illustrate the value of influence diagnostics.","tags":["latent basis growth model","psychometrics","growth curves","finite mixture models","longitudinal data"],"date":"2023-02-02T19:17:39.868097","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e4wk3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/e4wk3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/e4wk3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e4wk3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_538"}

People who successfully predict others\u2019 emotions experience significant social advantages. What makes a person good at predicting emotions? To predict others\u2019 future emotional states, a person must know how one emotion transitions to the next. People learn how emotions transition from at least two sources: (i) internal information, or one\u2019s own emotion experiences, and (ii) external information, such as the social cues detected in a person\u2019s face. Across five studies, we find evidence that both sources of information are related to accurate emotion prediction: individuals with atypical personal emotion transitions, difficulty understanding their own emotional experiences, and impaired emotion perception displayed impaired emotion prediction. This ability to predict others\u2019 emotions has real-world social implications. Individuals who make accurate emotion predictions have better relationships with their friends and communities and experience less loneliness. In contrast, disruptions in both internal and external information sources explain prediction inaccuracy in individuals with social difficulties, specifically with social communication difficulties common in autism spectrum disorder.

The current study examined demographic, disease-related and psychological correlates of patient non-participation (\u201crefusers\u201d), and loss to follow-up (\u201cdrop-outs\u201d) in a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease. We also examined whether, in comparison to participants, refusers and drop-outs differed in their likelihood to start cardiac rehabilitation and their survival status. \n\nMethod: Participants who dropped out (n=376; mean age=67.5\u00b1122; 70% men), and refusers (n=148; mean age=71.8\u00b112.6; 69% men) were compared with active participants (n=865; mean age=65.1\u00b111.8; 79% men). Demographics, clinical risk factors, medical history, participation to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and mortality were obtained from patients\u2019 medical records and baseline questionnaires. Information about psychological symptoms (GAD-7, PHQ-9, DS14) was derived from medical records for patients who started CR in hospital. For patients who did not participate to CR but who participated in the study, psychological data were completed with study questionnaire data. \n\nResults: Compared to participants, refusers were older (OR= 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.07; p = .002), had a lower socio-economic status (OR= 2.78; 95% CI: 1.52-5.07; p = .001) were more often smokers (OR= 1.64; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58; p = .03), and experienced a larger burden of illness (cardiac history: OR= 1.56; 95% CI: 1.03-2.37; p = .04; non-cardiac history: OR= 1.97; 95% CI: 1.24-3.13; p = .004). Refusers also participated less often in CR, independent of age and sex (OR= .69; 95% CI: .48-.99, p = .04). They also showed increased mortality as compared to patients who initially decided to participate (10% vs. 5%; OR= 2.09; 95% CI: 1.14-3.85, p = .02). Compared to participants, drop-outs were more often women (OR= 1.48; 1.08-2.03, p = .02). In drop-outs, increased levels of smoking (OR = 1.51; 1.13-2.02, p = .01), and a larger burden of illness were found (non-cardiac history: OR= 1.31; 95% CI: 1.00-1.71; p = .05). We did not find any differences between the groups regarding psychological symptoms.\n\nConclusion: Refusers and drop-outs differed systematically on some demographics and disease-related factors, which was translated into poorer health outcomes, as there were differences in the mortality risk of refusers versus participants. Therefore, we conclude that results from survey studies examining the association between psychosocial factors and health outcomes may underestimate the effects, as a healthier sample is participating than is present in the real life population.","tags":["predictors","cohort","drop-out","refusal","mortality","heart disease"],"date":"2023-02-02T20:24:16.710776","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/uqcgy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/uqcgy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/uqcgy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/uqcgy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_540"}

The concept of resonance has played an important role in ecological psychology, but it remains a metaphor. Supplying a mechanistic account of resonance requires a non-representational account of central nervous system (CNS) dynamics. We present a series of simple models in which a reservoir network with homeostatic nodes is used to control a simple agent embedded in an environment. This network spontaneously produces behaviors that are adaptive in each context, including (1) visually tracking a moving object, (2) substantially above-chance performance in the arcade game Pong, (2) and avoiding walls while controlling a mobile agent. These results may represent a useful step towards a mechanistic grounding of resonance and a view of the CNS that is compatible with ecological psychology.","tags":["perception-action","reservoir computing","computational cognitive neuroscience","ecological psychology"],"date":"2023-02-02T20:29:02.500885","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Action","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pt7bn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pt7bn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pt7bn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pt7bn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_541"}

Therefore, clozapine remains the gold standard not only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia but also for a larger number of patients with a poor course of illness. Furthermore, recent meta-analytical evidence clearly demonstrates the superiority of clozapine for reducing all-cause mortality. This finding indicates that clozapine is one of the most potent means to reduce the outrageous mortality gap faced by patients with schizophrenia. \nDespite its unmatched and wide-ranging efficacy as well as its cost effectiveness, clozapine remains alarmingly underutilized throughout the industrialized world even though patients\u2019 acceptance of clozapine treatment is surprisingly high. While limited, existing evidence indicates that this is primarily due to psychiatrists\u2019 concerns regarding safety and side effect management possibly resulting from insufficient clinical training in using clozapine. This would imply that many patients are never offered clozapine in the first place despite a clear indication. \nWe argue that psychiatrists have an urgent obligation to address this issue and ensure sufficient availability of this vital treatment option. If our fields\u2019 commitment to shared decision-making is to be genuine, we must not exclude patients from the potentially life-changing decision to initiate clozapine treatment. Therefore, concerted research and mental-health policy efforts should focus on identifying barriers for clozapine utilization and effective measures to overcome them. On the one hand, this will require structural changes to clinical training and care systems. On the other and hand \u2013 and at least as important \u2013 it will require a continued commitment of individual psychiatrists to align their attitudes and clinical practices more closely with the existing evidence and patient preference.

Participants were 51% male and 72% White.  A series of growth models revealed that not having a trusted adult at school was a strong risk factor for internalizing symptoms over the school year. Moreover, lack of a trusted adult predicted worsening internalizing symptoms over time for middle and high school students. Finally, lack of a trusted adult was also a significant predictor for end-of-year indicators of school disengagement and perceived need for support.

This study involved a 2 \u00d7 3 research design. In total, 235 Chinese EFL learners were allocated to the six conditions. Vocabulary learning outcomes were measured by pre- and post-tests on 24 target items. The results showed that the definition + information + videos group scored significantly higher than the definition + information and the definition-only groups. Additionally, the sentence-writing task increased the effectiveness of vocabulary learning versus the condition without this task. The combination of the definition + information + videos condition and sentence-writing task was identified as the most effective technique for learning lexical items. This study high- lighted the effectiveness of combining multimedia input with a sentence-writing task to learn new words.

We develop and apply the Social Media Mindsets scale, revealing that agentic, positive mindsets are associated with better well-being and low-agency, negative mindsets are associated with worse well-being (Studies 1, 2a, and 2b). Notably, these mindsets explained more variance in relational well-being and psychological distress than other measures (Study 3), and were related to differences in how people used social media and interpreted the time they spent on it (Studies 3-4).

Yet, the benefits of engaging in meaningful social interactions in the different contexts of daily life remain understudied.  Using three large-scale longitudinal datasets collected from a cohort of university students over the span of 3 years ( N = 5,649 participants;  ecological momentary assessments = 215,209), we examined the extent to which engagement in subjectively meaningful social interactions was associated with improvements in subsequent momentary well-being across contexts. We found that people reported experiencing less momentary stress, loneliness, and greater affective well-being after engaging in meaningful social interaction, but less benefits socializing in certain contexts (e.g., with strangers, computer-mediated channels, in public places, while dining, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic). These findings support the idea that the people, communication channels, places, activities, and timing of meaningful social interactions matter for subsequent momentary well-being.","tags":["Context","Social Interaction","Experience Sampling","Well-Being"],"date":"2023-02-03T07:49:09.929411","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gu4pv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gu4pv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gu4pv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gu4pv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_546"}
{"osf_id":"76k8w","title":"Conceptualising user comfort in automated driving: Findings from an expert group workshop","description":"Automated driving needs to be comfortable to encourage the broad acceptance and usage of automated vehicles (AVs). However, current research provides limited knowledge on the descriptions and influencing factors of user comfort in automated driving, especially from the perspective of an AV\u2019s driving styles. This paper presents results from an online workshop, in which nine experts with hands-on experience of AVs, and a long track record of research in this context, brainstormed and discussed a series of topics related to user comfort in automated driving. Results showed that a wide range of terms were used to describe user comfort and discomfort, when the attendees considered being driven by either currently available transport modes (e.g., taxi\/bus\/train) or higher-level AVs (with neither requiring control of the vehicle by the user). All of the terms used for existing vehicles were found to apply to AVs, but additional aspects of comfort\/discomfort were revealed for AVs. This suggests that what makes existing transport modes comfortable is not the same as that for higher-level AVs. Regarding the relationship between comfort and discomfort in automated driving, seven and ten categories of terms were identified for comfort and discomfort, respectively, with both the number and the nature of these categories differing across the two states. This suggests that, to ensure user comfort in automated driving, additional factors that affect comfort must be considered, rather than solely mitigating discomfort. By integrating these multiple aspects that affect user comfort, knowledge from the workshop was used to develop a conceptual framework, to explain how AV driving styles, as well as other, non-driving-related factors, affect user comfort, from both a physical and psychological perspective. This work provides an overview of experts\u2019 insights on the factors that affect comfort in automated driving, and will facilitate a more comprehensive definition, and more accurate measurement, of user comfort, facilitating the design of more comfortable and acceptable automated driving for future vehicles.","tags":["expert workshop","driving styles","conceptual framework","automated vehicles","user comfort"],"date":"2023-02-03T08:47:02.867882","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/76k8w\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/76k8w\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/76k8w","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/76k8w","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_547"}

We consider it more probable that mental states, such as love, continue after biological death than we think bodily states, such as hunger, will continue. However the extent to which culture affects mind-body dualism remains unclear. Here, we draw on a large and diverse cross-cultural sample (24 countries, N = 10195) to systematically quantify cultural variation in tendencies for mind-body dualism. Our findings replicate previous work suggesting that mind-body dualism is culturally universal. Furthermore, our experiment reveals that religion amplifies dualistic tendencies. At the same time, however, the modal response across most countries was the cessation of all states. In addition, explicit afterlife beliefs were more prevalent than implicit afterlife beliefs (i.e., continuity judgments). Overall, these data suggest that intuitive materialism is the cross-cultural norm, with dualism arising from culturally acquired beliefs.","tags":["mind-body dualism","bayesian hierarchical modeling","culture","religion","afterlife beliefs"],"date":"2023-02-03T10:13:43.124381","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Cross-cultural Psychology","Religion and Spirituality","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tvycp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tvycp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tvycp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tvycp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_548"}

The fundamental nature of joint attention in the context of social cognition has led researchers to develop tasks that address this mechanism and operationalize it in a laboratory setting, in the form of a gaze cueing paradigm. In present paper we adapted a classical gaze-cueing paradigm such that a robot avatar cued participants\u2019 gaze subsequent to either engaging participants in mutual gaze or averting gazeaway. Our critical question of interest was whether the gaze cueing effect (GCE) is stable across different cultures, especially if cognitive resources to exert top-down modulation are reduced. To achieve the latter, we introduced a mathematical stress task orthogonally to the gaze cueing protocol. Results showed larger GCE in the Singapore sample, relative to the Italian sample, independent of gaze type (mutual vs. avoiding) or amount of experienced stress, which translates to available cognitive resources.  Moreover, since after each block, participants rated how engaged they felt with the robot avatar during the task, we observed that Italian participants rated as more engaging the avatar during the mutual gaze blocks, relative to avoiding gaze while Singaporean participants did not show any difference in engagement between mutual and avoiding blocks. We discuss the results in terms of cultural differences in robot-induced joint attention, and engagement in mutual gaze, as well as the dissociation between implicit and explicit measures related to processing of gaze.","tags":["Cross-Cultural Differences","Implicit and Explicit Measures","Joint Attention","Gaze Cueing"],"date":"2023-02-03T10:24:58.954848","doi":null,"subjects":["Cultural Psychology","Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Cross-cultural Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/d4u6c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/d4u6c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/d4u6c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/d4u6c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_549"}
{"osf_id":"mz4rt","title":"Adopting the intentional stance interferes with social attention when interacting with a social robot","description":"Joint attention is a pivotal mechanism of human social cognition. Traditionally, joint attention has been experimentally investigated by means of the gaze cueing task in screen-based settings. Recently, the gaze cueing task has been implemented in more naturalistic and interactive settings with the embodied iCub robot, allowing for the investigation of concurrent factors influencing joint attention. Previous studies found that a communicative gaze before the gaze cue (i.e., mutual or avoiding gaze with the participants) influenced the subsequent joint attention by eliciting the gaze-cueing effect only in the mutual gaze condition. In the present work, we first manipulated the attribution of the intentional stance toward the robot by letting participants share a familiar context. Subsequent to this shared experience, we integrated the gaze-cueing paradigm with the iCub robot, such that the robot cued participants\u2019 attention after establishing either mutual or avoiding gaze with them. In contrast to previous studies where the adoption of the intentional stance was not manipulated, our current results show that when the robot was perceived as an intentional agent, a gaze-cueing effect was present for both mutual and avoiding gaze, thereby suggesting that participants might have interpreted both gaze conditions as intentional (and, thus as communicative signals).","tags":["Intentional Stance","Joint Attention","Gaze Cueing"],"date":"2023-02-03T10:35:35.709743","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mz4rt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mz4rt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mz4rt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mz4rt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_550"}

Thus, it calls for examining whether exposure to technological knowledge about the mechanical workings of humanoid robots can affect children\u2019s perception of robots as agents with intentionality (i.e., adoption of the Intentional Stance). In this study, we presented a group of school children with a two-hour theoretical and practical workshop focused on programming robotic components. In two sessions, namely before (Pre Session) and after the workshop (Post Session), we administered the InStance Test (IST), to assess whether children\u2019s likelihood of adopting the Intentional Stance was modulated by the knowledge children acquired about robots during the workshop. Results showed no significant difference in the IST scores across sessions, indicating that exposure to technological knowledge did not modulate the likelihood of adopting the Intentional Stance across the sessions.

As such, it is essential to look at patients\u2019 self-evaluation in addition to objective assessments. The goals of the current study were to (1) examine the sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors related to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) perception; (2) analyze the complex mutual interconnections between SCIs; and (3) address patients\u2019 perspectives on SCI and supportive care.\nMethod: A heterogeneous sample of oncological patients (N = 566; 68.6% female; M = 54, SD = 14.2, the most prevalent being breast cancer - 31.1%) was recruited. \nEighteen items covering the senses, attention, memory, spatial functions, decision-making and speech were administered. The response scale was constructed to reflect the chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) theories. A network of subjectively perceived changes in cognitive functions was estimated while three open-ended questions addressed patients\u2019 perspectives on SCI.\nResults: Within the network, deficits in spatial perception, attention focus and problem-solving ability were the highest on the strength index while the deficits related to the senses were the least influential. From the moderating factors, finishing chemotherapy, cancer relapse, pain, PTSD and sadness caused invariance in the network\u2019s global strength or structure. \nConclusion: The findings indicate that psychological-based interventions focused on higher cognitive functions could improve patients\u2019 quality of life.

After another 300 trials (Phase 2), videos were swapped between groups; 300 further trials (Phase 3) followed.

There was a significant interaction between Group and Phase for reaction times: in Phase 3, the group who had just watched the avatar with helmet, had a reduced advantage to the feature-cued side. Hence, interpreting the disk as turning head seen from behind counteracts the cueing by the disk\u2019s motion.

So the media success of this series is not even questioned. However, one question has emerged and there is no unanimous answer: is Tim Burton's character Wednesday Addams autistic? \n\tAfter a brief presentation of the character of Wednesday in the work of Charles Addams, I analyze the character of Wednesday Addams through the autistic characteristics described by Grunya Sukhareva, Hans Asperger, Leo Kanner and the fifth revised version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) based on the work of Lorna Wing. It appears that Wednesday Addams corresponds rather well to the autistic prototypes described by Sukhareva and Asperger but that it is more complicated to confirm or deny if the observed behaviors of Wednesday Addams fit well into the characteristics of the DSM autism spectrum disorder. Additional elements are questioned and brought to light, namely her intelligence, her education and a possible conduct disorder. \n\tFinally, this work, beyond its potential clinical interest, allows highlighting three current debates in autism research: autistic dimensions vs. autistic categories, the vision of autism considered as a disorder vs. autism considered as a difference and the questioning of the existence of a female autistic phenotype. I conclude this work by affirming that this new series seems to be more in line with a social movement of empowerment of women and girls through popular culture than of affirmation and positive representation of the female autistic phenotype in cinema.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\tLa s\u00e9rie \u00ab\u2009Mercredi\u2009\u00bb r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Tim Burton est devenue la deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie anglophone la plus regard\u00e9e de tous les temps sur Netflix et la troisi\u00e8me toutes langues confondues avec pr\u00e8s d\u20191,24 milliard d\u2019heures de visionnage et le nombre de visionnages sur TikTok se compte en plusieurs dizaines de milliards de vues.

We present a research paradigm that gives participants control over the information search by allowing them to collect their own information samples. The present work investigates how people explore the social environment and how the sampled information informs the impressions that people form. Four experiments tested theoretically driven predictions related to information sampling patterns under interested and disinterested information search targeting the trustworthiness of several social targets. Under interested information search, we documented the early truncation of the sampling of social targets that showed untrustworthy behavior early on. Under disinterested information search, participants sampled the social targets more extensively and systematically, avoiding small sample biases. Our experiments further show that, once obtained, the sampled information accurately determines the final impression.

In the present paper, we analyzed trends based on online and offline (in-laboratory) sample sizes in randomly sampled articles (N = 1,000) published in five general and experimental psychology journals in each year from 2003 to 2022. While our samples included no online participants at all in the early 2000s, in recent years\u2019 publications we indeed found soaring online sample sizes (per article as well as per study), with online participants accounting for almost two thirds of all participants. At the same time, offline sample sizes increased only slightly, and comparatively negligibly. The generally increased sample sizes likely bode well for replicability and robustness, but the potential pitfalls of this rapid migration to online research warrant thoughtful and thorough further examinations.","tags":["experimental psychology","metascience","statistical power","online research","research methods","sample size"],"date":"2023-02-03T12:55:42.161154","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Quantitative Methods","Experimental Design and Sample Surveys","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rebqd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rebqd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rebqd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rebqd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_557"}

Our behavioral results show that participants experienced JSoA with the partner when it was presented as seemingly intentional, but not when  it was presented as a seemingly unintentional. Our EEG results support the idea that when a partner is introduced as intentional, self- and other-forward models are better integrated into a joint model, relative to when the partner is introduced as unintentional.

Theory predicts that reliable communication of commitment is afforded by costly signals that track cooperative intent. Across four pre-registered studies (total N = 1,440, general US population), we used the public goods game where groups competed for resources to investigate whether and how costly signals function to assort cooperators. We found that costly signals assorted more cooperative participants, creating groups that would win most of the between-group clashes. The same effects were not observed when participants were assigned to signal, implying that signaling tracks but does not create cooperative intent. However, contrary to costly signaling theory, we found that low cost signals were more effective in cooperator assortment compared to high cost signals and suggest that future studies need to focus on signaler perception of cost\/benefit trade-off of signaling.","tags":["intergroup conflict","public goods game","costly signaling theory","parochial altruism","sacrifice"],"date":"2023-02-03T15:48:41.804543","doi":"10.1016\/j.evolhumbehav.2024.01.003","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Evolutionary Biology","Intergroup Processes","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3akxq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3akxq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3akxq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3akxq","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.evolhumbehav.2024.01.003","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_561"}

{"osf_id":"dm8xn","title":"An aberrant abundance of Cronbach\u2019s alpha values at .70","description":"Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) is the most widely reported metric of the reliability of psychological measures. Decisions about an observed \u03b1\u2019s adequacy are often made using rule-of-thumb thresholds, such as \u03b1 of at least .70. Such thresholds can put pressure on researchers to make their measures meet these criteria, similar to the pressure to meet the significance threshold with p values. We examined whether \u03b1 values reported in the literature are inflated at the rule-of-thumb thresholds (\u03b1 = .70, .80, .90), due to, for example, overfitting to in-sample data (\u03b1-hacking) or publication bias. We extracted reported \u03b1 values from three very large datasets covering the general psychology literature (&gt;30,000 \u03b1 values taken from &gt;74,000 published articles in APA journals), the Industrial and Organizational psychology literature (&gt;89,000 \u03b1 values taken from &gt;14,000 published articles in I\/O journals), and the APA\u2019s PsycTests database which aims to cover all psychological measures published since 1894 (&gt;67,000 \u03b1 values taken from &gt;60,000 measures). The distributions of these values show robust evidence of excesses at the \u03b1 = .70 rule-of-thumb threshold which cannot be explained by justifiable scale modifications. We discuss the scope, causes, and consequences of \u03b1-hacking and how increased transparency, preregistration of measurement strategy, and standardized protocols could mitigate this problem.

{"osf_id":"qr26x","title":"Reputational Costs of Receptiveness:  When and Why Being Receptive to Opposing Political Views Backfires","description":"A fast-growing body of research finds that receptiveness to opposing political views carries reputational benefits. A different body of research finds that opposing political views and the people who hold them are seen as repugnant. How could it be that people receptive to opposing political ideas are viewed positively, when the political opponents they are receptive to are seen negatively? In seven main (N = 5,286) and nine supplemental studies (N = 3,983 participants in online studies; N = 124,493 observations in field data), we reconcile this tension by showing that when the information source belongs to the opposing party, receptiveness to opposing political views often carries reputational costs, not benefits. We find these reputational costs across both strong and weak signals of receptiveness, eight different political and social issues, and multiple types of prototypical out-party sources. We argue that these costs arise because members of the opposing party are frequently stereotyped as immoral, and thus receptiveness to their ideas is seen negatively. As a boundary condition, we find that the costs of receptiveness are pronounced for sources who are prototypical of the out-party and attenuate (or even reverse) for sources who are non-prototypical. These findings resolve a seeming contradiction between two distinct literatures in psychology, contribute to a rapidly expanding literature on the interpersonal consequences of receptiveness, and lay the groundwork for understanding novel barriers to, and ultimately solutions for, the lack of cross-party openness and political polarization.","tags":["Receptiveness","partisan identity","person perception","political polarization","prototypicality","morality","open-mindedness"],"date":"2023-02-03T18:41:46.113921","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Moral Behavior","Impression Formation","Interpersonal Relationships","Intergroup Processes","Attitudes and Persuasion","Intragroup Processes","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qr26x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qr26x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qr26x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qr26x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_565"}

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) reduces both withdrawal and anxiety symptoms; however, the extent to which withdrawal reductions depend on anxiety reductions isn\u2019t known, which this study was designed to address. The two predictions were that 1) there would be a positive relationship between withdrawal symptoms and state anxiety (anxiety symptoms in the present moment) and 2) rTMS-related reductions in state anxiety would mediate reductions in withdrawal. Participants (N = 44) were adults ages 18 - 45 who reported daily use of 5+ cigarettes for 1+ years. Participants received single-session rTMS (10 Hz at 100% of motor threshold; 5s on; 10s off; 3000 pulses total) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; experimental site) and the visual cortex (v5; control site) in a randomized, crossover, single-blind, within-subjects design. They completed the Shiffman-Jarvik Withdrawal Scale (SJWS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after each rTMS treatment. There were significant positive correlations between withdrawal and state anxiety before and after rTMS, p &lt; .001. A mixed-effects linear model indicated that rTMS to dlPFC led to a significant reduction in SJWS craving subscale scores, p &lt; .05. However, a mediation analysis suggested that state anxiety did not mediate the reduction in SJWS scores, p &gt; .05. Withdrawal and state anxiety were positively related before and after rTMS, and rTMS to dlPFC reduced cigarette craving. Reductions in cigarette craving by rTMS were not mediated by effects of rTMS on feelings of anxiety. With the goal of understanding how rTMS influences the cognitive and affective markers of smoking, this study was a step towards elucidating the psychological mechanisms of rTMS on cigarette withdrawal and craving.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-03T20:48:43.535013","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qkx5s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qkx5s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qkx5s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qkx5s","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_566"}
{"osf_id":"j38rn","title":"Absolute pitch judgments of familiar melodies generalize across timbre and octave","description":"Most listeners can determine when a familiar recording of music has been shifted in musical key by as little as one semitone (e.g., from B to C major). However, it is unclear how this form of pitch memory relates to absolute pitch (AP) representations, which are based on pitch chroma. This is because listeners could use spectral cues from the familiar instrumentation of the original recordings or strategies based on pitch height (e.g., relying on a feeling that an incorrect recording sounds \u201ctoo high\u201d or \u201ctoo low\u201d) to determine when a familiar recording has been shifted in pitch. Neither of these strategies would require the kind of understanding of pitch chroma or musical key associated with AP. The present experiments thus assessed whether listeners could make accurate absolute pitch judgments when listening to novel renditions of these familiar melodies, differing from the iconic recording in complexity and timbre (Experiment 1) or timbre and octave (Experiment 2). These experiments eliminate the possibility of reliance on spectral cues and pitch height, respectively. Listeners in both experiments selected the correct-key version of the familiar melody at rates that were significantly above chance. These results fit within a growing body of research supporting the idea that most listeners, regardless of formal musical training, have robust representations of absolute pitch - based on pitch chroma - that generalize to novel listening situations. Implications for theories of auditory pitch memory are discussed.","tags":["music cognition","absolute pitch","generalization","memory"],"date":"2023-02-03T21:01:49.834519","doi":"10.3758\/s13421-023-01429-z","subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Music","Memory","Audition","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j38rn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j38rn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j38rn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j38rn","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3758\/s13421-023-01429-z","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_567"}

Parental reports, such as the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, are commonly used in language development research due to their ease of use and ability to provide extensive data. However, there have been concerns about the accuracy of these reports in assessing comprehension, as parents can only infer comprehension from nonverbal responses. To address this issue, this study employs eye-tracking measures of word comprehension to compare the correlation and alignment between direct measures and parental reports. The results show that there is no correlation between word recognition performance and CDI percentile. The frequency of weekly reading was found to be correlated with both parent-reported language ability and direct measures of word comprehension. The comparison of the scores of parent-reported target words and word recognition measurements indicate that parents tend to report items more positively than the children's actual recognition of the words.","tags":["frequency of weekly reading","word comprehension","Korean infants","language assessment measures","parent-reported","direct measures","MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories","eye-tracking measures","convergent validity"],"date":"2023-02-04T02:54:35.335501","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Infancy","Language Aquisition","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Early Childhood"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5q24v\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5q24v\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5q24v","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5q24v","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_568"}
{"osf_id":"64bjc","title":"Social isolation strengthens the association between intersubject similarity in fantasy and similarity in affective appraisal","description":"The Covid-19 pandemic lockdown had led to unusually mas- sive social isolation that lasted for months around the world. In order to compensate for the poverty of social life, individ- uals are likely to shift their attention from their regular social world to their inner imaginative world during this lockdown pe- riod. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether intersubject similarity in individuals\u2019 imaginative abilities (i.e., fantasy tendency) is associated with their similarity in affective ratings of the videos they watched, and whether this associa- tion is enhanced during the pandemic lockdown period. We recruited one lockdown group and two post-lockdown groups to test the above hypothesis. During the experiment, partici- pants were asked to watch a series of videos covering a wide range of topics, and then they were asked to complete several affective appraisal ratings (e.g., liking or feeling of resonance) of each video. We then used intersubject representational similar- ity analysis (ISRSA) to map the intersubject similarity in their fantasy tendency onto their similarity in the affective appraisal ratings. Our results showed that those who were more simi- lar in their fantasy scores also showed more similarity in their affective appraisals of videos. Most importantly, this fantasy- appraisal association was particularly strong in the lockdown group, but rather weak in the post-lockdown groups. Our find- ings suggest that individual differences in their imaginative abil- ities would become a crucial factor influencing how individuals appraise their inner world during social isolation. The current study may provide an example for policymakers on how to as- sess the impact of social isolation as we may face another wave of pandemics in the future.","tags":["ISRSA","social isolation","fantasy","Covid-19","pandemic lockdown","affective appraisal"],"date":"2023-02-04T11:48:36.955320","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Personality and Situations","Individual Differences","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/64bjc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/64bjc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/64bjc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/64bjc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_569"}

We tested the theory that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show enhanced processing of acoustic features and impaired processing of semantic information. \nMethods: We used a change deafness task that required detection of speech and non-speech auditory objects being replaced and a speech-in-noise task using spoken sentences that must be comprehended in the presence of background speech to examine the extent to which 7-15 year old children with ASD (n=27) rely on acoustic and semantic information, compared to age-matched (n=27) and IQ-matched (n=27) groups of typically developing (TD) children. Within a larger group of 7-15 year old TD children (n=105) we correlated IQ, ASD symptoms, and the use of acoustic and semantic information.\nResults: Children with ASD performed worse overall at the change deafness task relative to the age-matched TD controls, but they did not differ from IQ-matched controls. All groups utilized acoustic and semantic information similarly and displayed an attentional bias towards changes that involved the human voice. Similarly, for the speech-in-noise task, age-matched--but not IQ-matched--TD controls performed better overall than the ASD group. However, all groups used semantic context to a similar degree. Among TD children, neither IQ nor the presence of ASD symptoms predict the use of acoustic or semantic information. \nConclusion: Children with and without ASD used acoustic and semantic information similarly during auditory change deafness and speech-in-noise tasks.

This study considered how fWHR informs how professional wrestling fans evaluate the effectiveness of men in their performance. Participants evaluated the extent to which men appeared effective at utilizing various performance styles and how likely they would be to promote these men to the top positions in a company. High-fWHR men appeared most effective as brawlers and powerhouses but less effective in more technical performances compared to low-fWHR men.

{"osf_id":"mt39y","title":"Moral barrier to compassion: How perceived badness of sufferers dampens observers\u2019 compassionate responses","description":"Compassion has been theorized as a desirable prosocial emotion due to its potential to transcend arbitrary boundaries (e.g., race, physical distance) and motivate us to alleviate the suffering of all human beings. Our paper nevertheless examines a potential moral barrier to compassion\u2013\u2013whether and how moral evaluations of the suffering and the sufferer hinder our compassion and prosocial motivation. In four pre-registered studies (total N = 421, within-participant design), we demonstrated that adult U.S. participants withheld their compassion and willingness to help when they perceived moral badness of the sufferer, even when the perceived moral badness did not directly cause the suffering. The effects were found in terms of diverse types of moral judgments, including the sufferers\u2019 immoral intention (e.g., harming another; Study 1), bad moral character (e.g., being a dishonest person; Study 2), and even mere associations with groups perceived as deserving of suffering based on moral status (Studies 3-4). Deservedness judgment\u2013\u2013how much the sufferer was viewed as deserving the suffering\u2013\u2013mediated the effect between moral judgment and compassionate responses. Importantly, participants judged withholding compassion based on moral deservedness as what should be done and what morally good people would do, suggesting that people hold a normative view of the tendency that might make it difficult to overcome. Our findings thus reveal moral judgment as a barrier that prevents us from alleviating the suffering of all human beings.","tags":["help","deservedness","suffering","compassion","morality"],"date":"2023-02-04T22:19:50.977511","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mt39y\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mt39y\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mt39y","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mt39y","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_573"}
{"osf_id":"9qfsz","title":"Flexibility in continuous judgements of gender\/sex and race","description":"Across six pre-registered studies (N = 1292; recruited from university subject pools and Prolific Academic), we investigate how face perception along the dimensions of gender\/sex and race can vary based on immediate contextual information as well as personal experience. In Studies 1a and 1b we find that when placing stimuli along a continuum from male to female, cisgender participants sort prototypical gender\/sex faces in a bimodal fashion and show less consensus and greater error when placing faces of intermediate gender\/sex. We replicate and extend these findings to race in Study 2. In Study 3, we test whether sorting patterns can be influenced by pre-existing experiences, and find evidence that transgender\/nonbinary participants show less error than cisgender heterosexual participants when sorting intermediary faces. Finally, in Studies 4 and 5, we test whether cisgender participants\u2019 judgments of intermediary faces along the continuum are influenced by the specific circumstances under which they are asked to sort. Here, we find that changing the sorting framework to include a third category resulted in less error when placing intermediary faces along the continuum than when participants were provided with only two category labels or two categories and a line at the midpoint, suggesting that new perceptual categories introduced with minimal training can be adopted quickly and successfully in a perceptual task. These data suggest that both long term life experiences and quick experimental interventions can shape how we think about  gender\/sex and race.","tags":["race","gender","face perception","social cognition","categorization"],"date":"2023-02-04T23:04:06.866837","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9qfsz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9qfsz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9qfsz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9qfsz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_574"}

{"osf_id":"zjhpt","title":"Human-Human Communication in Cyber Threat  Situations: A Systematic Review","description":"Abstract. In cyber threat situations, decision-making within organizations and between the affected organization and external entities are high-stake situations. They require human communication entailing technical complexity, time pressure, interdisciplinary, and often insufficient information basis. Communication in cyber threat situations within socio-technical systems can thus be challenging and has a variety of implications for decision-making. The cyber-physical system is a rapidly changing socio-technical system that is understudied in terms of how cyber events are communicated and acted upon to secure and maintain cyber resilience. The present study is the first to review human-to-human communication in cyber threat situations. Our aims are to (1) outline how human-human communication performance in cybersecurity settings have been studied; (2) to uncover areas where there is potential for developing common standards for information exchange in collaborative settings, and; (3) to provide guidance for future research efforts. The review was carried out according to the PRISMA guidelines and articles were searched for on Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Taylor &amp; Francis, and IEEE. Primary research articles and reviews focusing on human-human communication in cyber threat situations published in peer reviewed journals or as conference papers were included. A total of 17 studies were included in the final review. Most of the studies were correlational and exploratory in nature. Very few studies characterize communication in useful goal-related terms.","tags":["situational awareness","cyber threat information sharing","Cyber Threat Communication","human to human communication","human communication in cyber threat situations","systematic review","cyber threat intelligence","human factors","recognized cyber picture","threat and defense knowledge","ACDICOM","cyber situational awareness"],"date":"2023-02-05T01:21:20.410051","doi":"10.1007\/978-3-030-90328-2_2","subjects":["Performance Measurement","Informational Environments","Judgment and Decision Making","Social Settings","Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Human Resources","Psychology, other","Innovation and Technology","Environmental Psychology","Workgroup and Teams","Organizational Decision Making","Engineering Psychology","Training and Development","Ergonomics","Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Built Environments"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zjhpt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zjhpt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zjhpt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zjhpt","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-90328-2_2","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_576"}
{"osf_id":"a3w62","title":"Situational States Influence on Team Workload Demands in Cyber Defense Exercise","description":"Cyber operations are increasingly automated processes that can occur at computational speed with the intent of reducing, or denying time for good decision making or time to ground communication between human agents. There is a lack of performance measures and metrics in cyber operation settings. One potential setting describing human performance could be emotional stability under stress. Measures of higher individual affective variability indicate more emotional adaptability and allows for measuring individuals as dynamic systems. Previous research in other security-sensitive high-stake situations has shown that individuals with less emotional adaptability display maladaptive behaviors while individuals with more emotional adaptability can adapt more efficiently to changing situations, show more confidence in their own abilities and skills, and display better performance. We hypothesized that measurements of affective variability during a cyber defense exercise will be associated with team workload demands. Data was collected from 13 cadets during the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy\u2019s annual Cyber Defense Exercise. Three indicators of individual affective variability were measured daily with the Self-Assessment Manikin and compared to scores on the Team Workload Questionnaire. We found that affective variability was negatively associated with team workload demands. Participants with higher affective variability, as measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin, will impose less workload demands on the team, which can lead to better outcomes. This is the first study to assess how individual emotional adaptability affects team dynamics in a cyber defense setting. Future research should include variable measurements as they may have better explanatory power for performance measurements.","tags":["cyber team performance metrics","affective states","cyber defense exercise","emotion","cybersecurity","team workload demands","dlpfc","neuroergonomics","vagal tone"],"date":"2023-02-05T01:40:12.242444","doi":"10.1007\/978-3-030-90328-2_1","subjects":["Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Workgroup and Teams","Organizational Development","Emotion","Cognitive Neuroscience","Training and Development","Behavioral Neuroscience","Job Analysis","Employee Behavior and Motivation","Performance Measurement","Judgment and Decision Making","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Human Resources","Innovation and Technology","Engineering Psychology","Problem Solving","Ergonomics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/a3w62\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/a3w62\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/a3w62","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/a3w62","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-90328-2_1","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_577"}

In the two experiments, we found that dynamic norm information influenced perceived dynamic norms but not the preference for a meatless diet. Our Bayesian meta-analysis revealed a negligible effect size, d = 0.07, 90% CrI [0.01, 0.12], of the dynamic norm interventions on the preference for vegetarian meals.

Measures of intellectual curiosity vary widely in psychometric quality, and few measures have demonstrated validity and comparability of scores across multiple languages. We analyzed a novel, six-item intellectual curiosity scale (ICS) originally developed for cross-national comparisons in the context of the OECD\u2019s Programme for the International Assessment of Adults Competencies (PIAAC). Samples from six countries representing six national languages (US, Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and Japan; total N = 5,557) revealed that the ICS possesses very good psychometric properties. The scale is essentially unidimensional and showed excellent reliability estimates. On top of factorial validity, the scale demonstrated strict measurement invariance across demographic segments (gender, age groups, educational strata) and at least partial scalar invariance across countries. As per its convergent and divergent associations with a broad range of constructs (e.g., Open-Mindedness and other Big Five traits, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Job Orientations\/Vocational Interests), it also showed convincing construct validity. We recommend the ICS for assessing intellectual curiosity, especially in cross-cultural research applications, yet we also point out future research areas.","tags":["Typical Intellectual Engagement","Learning motivation","Readiness to learn","Non-cognitive skills","Epistemic curiosity","Need for cognition"],"date":"2023-02-05T22:01:22.276266","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Educational Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Individual Differences","Psychometrics","Cultural Differences","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kq5a2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kq5a2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kq5a2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kq5a2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_582"}

This could be due to a genuine lack of effects, or a spurious finding caused by methodological factors such as inadequate testing of theory-driven moderators, use of small homogenous samples, failure to model non-linear relationships, and over-reliance on significance testing. We probed explanations for the field\u2019s failure to detect moderators by testing whether 15 theory-driven and atheoretical variables moderated treatment outcome in a large heterogeneous sample treated with group CBT for SAD. Moderation was not assessed by only using p-values for linear models, but also by considering effect sizes, plots, and non-linear relationships. Despite using a comprehensive approach to assess moderation, only two variables \u2013 the baseline severity of SAD symptoms and fear of negative evaluation (FNE) \u2013 were found to moderate social anxiety symptom trajectories. FNE had a non-linear relationship with symptom change that would have been missed using common research methods. Our findings suggest both a genuine lack of effects and limitations of research methods have contributed to the field\u2019s inability to identify moderators. We provide suggestions that may increase the likelihood of future researchers detecting genuine effects.","tags":["Social Anxiety Disorder","Mental disorders","moderation","Social Phobia","moderator","SAD","Cognitive Behavior Therapy","Imagery enhanced CBT","Cognitive Behaviour Therapy","CBT"],"date":"2023-02-06T03:11:10.526603","doi":"10.1016\/j.janxdis.2023.102676","subjects":["Therapy","Psychotherapy","Mental Disorders","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cvdmt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cvdmt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cvdmt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cvdmt","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.janxdis.2023.102676","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_583"}

Such factors may include outcome expectancy, therapeutic alliance, presence (perception of being in the virtual environment) and social presence (perception of interacting with others). We report on findings from a pilot trial of VRET targeting social anxiety in people who stutter, and examine the association of these four factors with treatment outcome. People who stutter reporting heightened social anxiety (n = 22) took part in the trial after being recruited via online adverts. Remotely delivered VRET was administered to participants in three sessions across three weeks. Each session targeted both performative and interactive anxiety. A virtual therapist helped participants to engage with treatment strategies, whilst also guiding them through exercises. Findings showed that presence and social presence were both negatively related to changes in fear of negative evaluation between pre- and post-treatment. However, presence, outcome expectancy and therapeutic alliance were positively related to changes in social anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, outcome expectancy and therapeutic alliance were quadratically related to fear of negative evaluation change. Nevertheless, the effect of presence on social anxiety, and the effects of presence and therapeutic alliance on fear of negative evaluation must be interpreted with caution as these were not large enough to reach sufficient statistical power. Therapeutic alliance did not mediate the relationship between outcome expectancy and treatment outcome. These findings suggest that the current VRET protocol affected social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation differently. We discuss how presence may underlie these mixed associations. We also suggest that the unexpected positive effects on social anxiety symptoms may have resulted from insufficient treatment strategies which inadvertently encouraged maladaptive learning.","tags":["Therapeutic alliance","Outcome Expectancy","Exposure therapy","Presence","Virtual Reality","Stuttering","Social anxiety"],"date":"2023-02-06T03:42:45.256698","doi":null,"subjects":["Therapy","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tjdhx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tjdhx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tjdhx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tjdhx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_584"}

Yet, these findings are limited to few studies. Methods: We examined whether WTE at admission predicted treatment outcome in a sample of 324 inpatients with OCD who received a multimodal treatment that included cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention sessions. Results: Obsessive\u2013compulsive symptoms (based on OCD-specific self-report questionnaires) decreased and global functioning (based on therapist ratings) increased from admission to discharge. In contrast to previous findings, however, WTE did not predict treatment outcome. Conclusions: On the one hand, these results indicate that higher WTE at the beginning of inpatient treatment does not facilitate improvements in obsessive\u2013compulsive symptoms from admission to discharge. On the other hand, they also indicate that lower WTE at the beginning of inpatient treatment does not adversely affect treatment outcome, that is, even patients who indicate that they are unwilling to face the negative experiences associated with exposure and response prevention can still achieve considerable symptom reductions. While the current findings suggest that WTE at the beginning of treatment only plays a minor role at most in treating OCD, future studies may examine session-to-session changes in WTE and obsessive\u2013compulsive symptoms during treatment which may reveal a dynamic interplay as therapy progresses.","tags":["Willingness","Psychotherapy","Exposure and response prevention","Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder","Inpatient treatment"],"date":"2023-02-06T08:26:04.176322","doi":null,"subjects":["Obsessive-compulsive and Related Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kr5hw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kr5hw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kr5hw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kr5hw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_587"}

{"osf_id":"7sc4k","title":"Automating Hybrid Collective Intelligence in Open-Ended Medical Diagnostics","description":"Collective intelligence has emerged as a powerful mechanism to boost decision accuracy across many domains, such as geopolitical forecasting, investment, and medical diagnostics. However, collective intelligence has been mostly applied to relatively simple decision tasks (e.g., binary  classifications). Applications in more open-ended tasks with a much larger problem space, such as emergency management or general medical diagnostics, are largely lacking, due to the challenge of integrating unstandardized inputs from different crowd members. Here we present a fully-automated approach for harnessing collective intelligence in the domain of general medical diagnostics. Our approach leverages semantic knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and the SNOMED CT medical ontology to overcome a major hurdle to collective intelligence in open-ended medical diagnostics, namely to identify the intended diagnosis from unstructured text. We tested our method on 1,333 medical cases diagnosed on a medical crowdsourcing platform: The Human Diagnosis Project. Each case was independently rated by ten diagnosticians. Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of single diagnosticians with the collective diagnosis of differently-sized groups, we find that our method substantially increases diagnostic accuracy: while single diagnosticians achieved 46\\% accuracy, pooling the decisions of ten diagnosticians increased this to 76\\%. Improvements occurred across medical specialties, chief complaints, and diagnosticians' tenure levels. Our results show the life-saving potential of tapping into the collective intelligence of the global medical community to reduce diagnostic errors and increase patient safety.","tags":["Ontology","Collective intelligence","General medical diagnostics","Natural language processing"],"date":"2023-02-06T09:58:45.835807","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7sc4k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7sc4k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7sc4k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7sc4k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_589"}

Although MPT models typically refer to cognitive processes within single individuals, they have often been applied to group data aggregated across individuals. We investigate the conditions under which MPT analyses of aggregate data make sense. After introducing the notions of (a) structural aggregation invariance and (b) empirical aggregation invariance of MPT models, we show that any MPT model that holds at the level of single individuals must also hold at the aggregate level when it is both structurally and empirically aggregation invariant. Moreover, group-level parameters of aggregation-invariant MPT models are equivalent to the expected values (i.e., means) of the corresponding individual parameters. To investigate the robustness of MPT results for aggregate data when one or both of the invariance conditions are violated, we additionally performed a series of simulation studies, systematically manipulating (a) the sample sizes in different trees of the model, (b) model parameterization, (c) means and variances of crucial model parameters, and (d) their correlations with other parameters of the respective MPT model. Overall, our results show that MPT parameter estimates based on aggregate data are trustworthy under rather general conditions, provided that a few preconditions are met.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-06T12:47:34.935721","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/59csk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/59csk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/59csk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/59csk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_594"}
{"osf_id":"dv8sx","title":"Dark Loops: Contagion effects, consistency and chemosocial matrices in psychedelic-assisted therapy trials","description":"What happens when an emerging programme of medical research overlaps with a surging social movement? In this article we draw on the anthropological term \u2018chemosociality\u2019 to describe forms of sociality born of shared chemical exposure. Psychedelic administration in the context of recent clinical trials appears to have been particularly chemosocial in nature. We argue that one consequence is that psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) clinical research trials tend to breach key assumptions underlying the logic of causal inference used to establish efficacy. We propose the concept of dark loops to describe forms of sociality variously emerging from, and impacting participant experiences in, PAT trials. These dark loops are not recorded, let alone incorporated into the causal pathways in the interpretation of psychedelic trial data to date. We end with three positions which researchers might adopt in response to these issues: chemosocial minimisation where research is designed to attenuate or eliminate the effects of dark loops in trials; chemosocial description where dark loops (and their impacts) are openly and candidly documented, and chemosocial valorisation where dark loops are hypothesised to contribute to trial outcomes and actively drawn upon for positive effect. Our goal is to fold in an appreciation of how the increasingly-discussed hype surrounding psychedelic research and therapeutics continues to shape the phenomena under study in complex ways, even as trials become larger and more rigorous in their design.","tags":["psychedelic-assisted therapy","chemosociality","dark loops","clinical trials","causal inference","unblinding","SUTVA"],"date":"2023-02-06T13:22:44.753928","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychotherapy","Quantitative Methods","Psychopharmacology","Psychology, other","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/dv8sx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/dv8sx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/dv8sx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/dv8sx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_595"}
{"osf_id":"vkq7s","title":"A Two-Step Robust Estimation Approach for Inferring Within-person Relations in Longitudinal Design: Tutorial and Simulations","description":"Psychological researchers have shown an interest in disaggregating within-person variability from between-person differences. Especially for inferring reciprocal relations among variables at the within-person level, applications of the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with stable trait factors has increased rapidly. This paper provides a tutorial, simulation, and illustrative example of another recent approach proposed by Usami (2022a). This approach consists of a two-step procedure: within-person variability scores (WPVS) for each person, which are disaggregated from the stable traits of that person, are calculated using structural equation modeling, and causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome approach, such as by using structural nested mean models (SNMMs). This method assumes a data-generating process similar to that in RI-CLPM, and has several advantages: (i) the flexible inclusion of curvilinear and interaction effects for WPVS as latent variables, (ii) more accurate estimates of causal parameters for reciprocal relations can be obtained under certain conditions owing to them being doubly robust, even if unobserved time-varying confounders and model misspeci?fications exist, and (iii) the risk of obtaining improper solutions is minimized. After explaining the data-generating process and the analysis procedure using the R package DTRreg for SNMMs, estimation performances are compared with RI-CLPM through large-scale simulations. We show that the proposed approach works well in many conditions if longitudinal data with T\u22674 are available, and that the accuracy increases as T becomes larger. An analytic example using data regarding sleep habits and mental\nhealth statuses from the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) study is also provided.","tags":["DTRreg","random-intercept cross-lagged panel model","within-person relation","CLPM","cross-lagged panel model","causal inference","longitudinal data","struc- tural nested mean model","RI-CLPM","structural equation modeling"],"date":"2023-02-06T13:28:36.904064","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vkq7s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vkq7s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vkq7s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vkq7s","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_596"}

Addressing this issue requires knowledge of how male and female conversational agents\u2019 voices are perceived. Consequently, we investigated whether male and female conversational agents\u2019 voices are perceived differently for a range of traits commonly investigated in studies of natural human stimuli (trustworthy, emotionally stable, responsible, sociable, caring, attractive, intelligent, confident, weird, unhappy, mean, aggressive, dominant, competent, old, masculine, feminine).

Female voices were rated as significantly more feminine than male voices. These differences in how male and female conversational agents\u2019 voices are perceived may be usefully applied to the design of conversational agents to reduce their effects on gender-based stereotypes.

In contrast, we examined the roles of identity and functional indispensability in the context of separatist movements.

{"osf_id":"x36az","title":"Mixed-Effects Regression Weights for Advice Taking and Related Phenomena of Information Sampling and Utilization","description":"Objective: Advice taking and related research is dominated by deterministic weighting indices, specifically ratio-of-differences-based formulas for investigating informational influence. Their arithmetic is intuitively simple, but they pose several measurement problems and restrict research to a particular paradigmatic approach. As a solution, we propose to specify how strongly peoples\u2019 judgments are influenced by externally provided evidence by fitting corresponding mixed-effects regression models. Method: Our approach explicitly distinguishes between endogenous components, such as updated beliefs, and exogenous components, such as independent initial judgments and advice. Crucially, mixed-effects regression coefficients of various exogenous sources of information also reflect individual weighting, but are based on a conceptually consistent representation of the endogenous judgment process. The formal derivation of the proposed weighting measures is accompanied by a detailed elaboration on their most important technical and statistical subtleties. Results: We use this modeling approach to revisit empirical findings from several paradigms investigating algorithm aversion, sequential collaboration, and advice taking. In summary, we replicate and extend the original finding of algorithm appreciation, and initially demonstrate a lack of evidence for both systematic order effects in sequential collaboration as well as differential weighting of multiple pieces of advice. Conclusions: In addition to opening new avenues for innovative research, appropriate modeling of information sampling and utilization has the potential to increase the reproducibility and replicability of behavioral science. Furthermore, the proposed method is relevant beyond advice taking, as mixed-effects regression weights can also inform research on related cognitive phenomena such as multidimensional belief updating, anchoring effects, hindsight bias, or attitude change.","tags":["judge-advisor system","cognitive modeling","judgment formation","judgment and decision-making","algorithm aversion","order effects","sequential collaboration","attitude","weight of advice","advice taking","wisdom of crowds","hindsight bias","algorithm appreciation","belief updating","multilevel modeling","mixed-effects regression","augmented judgment and decision-making","anchoring"],"date":"2023-02-06T17:01:11.242842","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Judgment and Decision Making","Impression Formation","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Individual Differences","Psychology, other","Quantitative Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Attitudes and Persuasion","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x36az\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x36az\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x36az","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x36az","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_605"}

This paper reports a descriptive study that documents more systematically the presence of \u201cred flags\u201d indicative of paper mill activity in special issues from the Wiley-Hindawi Open Access publishing partnership. \n\nMethods: A spreadsheet was created from the Hindawi website with records for all published articles during 2022. Initial analysis focused on initial Editor Response Time (RT) in ten journals that had been identified by sleuths as having high rates of problematic papers. In a second step, the whole dataset was scrutinized to identify editors who had handled at least 10 articles. These were divided into those who had had at least one PubPeer comment flagging dubious content or citations, and those with no PubPeer comments.\nResults: A cutoff of 22 days was identified as corresponding to the 2nd percentile of Editor RT for regular articles not in special issues. Plots show that in the 10 selected journals, some special issues have 50% or more of Editor RTs below this cutoff, raising questions as to whether an appropriate peer review process had taken place.  Editors with articles flagged on PubPeer processed significantly more articles and had significantly shorter Editor RT than other editors. They often acted as editors in multiple issues. Other potential red flags, i.e., proportions of papers accepted without revision, or lack of diversity of author emails did not distinguish the two subgroups of editors. \n\nDiscussion: Relatively simple indicators, of number of articles processed and speed of editorial processing, can be used as red flags that suggest an editor should be investigated to ensure they are not part of a paper mill.  \n\nConclusion: To tackle paper mills, it is crucial to move from a focus on individual articles to identify and root out individuals who have used positions as guest editors of special issues to flood the literature with fraudulent material. It is hoped that this analysis makes a start in suggesting approaches that can be used to this end.","tags":["publication lag","fraud","paper mill","editors"],"date":"2023-02-06T17:25:02.022630","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6mbgv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6mbgv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6mbgv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6mbgv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_606"}
{"osf_id":"bqwte","title":"The impact of age and Alzheimer\u2019s disease on locus coeruleus mediated neuromodulation of neural circuits and goal-directed behavior","description":"Neuromodulators affect cognition and behavior via their actions on brain wide neural networks. The locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system is one of the brain\u2019s major neuromodulatory systems. Aging and neurological diseases lead to changes in brain structure that impact the normal functioning of brain networks and neuromodulatory systems. Although the precise nature of this impact, its diagnosis and quantification remain a challenge, recent studies in humans and in animal models have started to reveal details about the effects of intrinsic neuromodulators on neural networks and behavior. These recent findings are beginning to suggest how systems neuroscience approaches might help develop new tests to supplement the wide range of established clinical assays for testing cognitive deficits due to aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Here, I will review what we know about networks that perform computations driving perception and action and how these networks are affected by activation of the LC-NE system. I will examine what is known about aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease related changes in these networks and in the LC-NE system and the resulting impact on perception and action. I will discuss the relationships between activation of this system and changes in pupil size, recently explored with precision in humans and in animal models. I will examine how, when combined with perceptual or cognitive tests, these findings provide a basis for exploring the use of pupillometry as a non-invasive assay of age- and disease-related decline in neuromodulatory\nfunction.","tags":["locus coeruleus","pupil","Alzheimer's"],"date":"2023-02-06T18:06:29.207366","doi":null,"subjects":["Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology","Systems Neuroscience","Clinical Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bqwte\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bqwte\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bqwte","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bqwte","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_607"}

Using data from longitudinal cohort studies in the U.S. (n = 1,168) and the U.K. (n = 16,506), we largely reproduced their pattern of findings that attention and behavior problems measured across the course of childhood predicted a range of adult outcomes including educational attainment (\u03b2U.S. = -.22, \u03b2U.K. = -.13) and spending time in jail (ORU.S. = 1.74, ORU.K. = 1.48). We found that associations with outcomes in education, work, and finances diminished in the presence of additional covariates for children\u2019s home environment and achievement but associations for other outcomes were more robust. We also found that attention and behavior problems across distinct periods of childhood were associated with adult outcomes. Specific attention and behavior problems showed some differences in predicting outcomes in the U.S. cohort, with attention problems predicting lower educational attainment and hyperactivity\/impulsivity predicting ever spending time in jail. Together with the findings from Moffitt et al.

Social psychology has a rich history of studying polarization, and there is an important opportunity to refine and define its contributions to the present political realities. We do so in the context of one of the most pressing modern issues: climate change. We synthesize the literature on political polarization and its applications to climate change, and we propose lines of further research and intervention design. We focus on polarization in the United States, examining other countries when literature is available. The polarization literature emphasizes two types of mechanisms: individual-level psychological processes related to political ideology and group-level psychological processes related to partisan identification. We highlight the potential intervention strategies of circumventing solution aversion, leveraging superordinate identities, correcting misperceived norms, and having trusted experts and politicians communicate about climate change. Interventions that address group-level processes can be more effective than those that address individual-level processes. These areas of research and intervention development are particularly important given that behavioral interventions grounded in scientific research are one of our most promising tools to achieve the behavioral wedge we need to address climate change and to make progress on other policy issues.","tags":["affective polarization","social identities","social norms","political polarization","climate change","interventions"],"date":"2023-02-06T19:47:11.315093","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Politics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xz6wk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xz6wk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xz6wk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xz6wk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_609"}

Furthermore, neurodiversity is considered from different angles depending on the discipline and the individual. The medical model of disability based on a personal problem, the social model of disability based on a societal problem, the neurodiversity mixing innate, acquired, neurodevelopment and psychology in opposition to a norm, and the cognitive diversity highlighting the existence of different cognitions and neurophenotypes outside of psychopathology and the healthy-pathological opposition.

This link has only been examined in convenience samples and it is unknown how pathogen avoidance processes operate in populations experiencing prolonged and heightened pathogen threat such as healthcare professionals. We examined whether healthcare professionals demonstrate the same link between pathogen disgust and intergroup bias as has been documented among the general population. \n\nMethodology: Participants (N=317; 210 healthcare professionals) were recruited using snowball sampling to take an online survey. Participants completed the Three Domain Disgust Scale to assess pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust. Participants then rated their perceptions of a fictitious immigrant group (\u201cKrasneeans\u201d) and the degree to which they endorsed group-binding moral values.\n\nResults: Compared to control participants, healthcare professionals reported lower levels of pathogen disgust, but not sexual or moral disgust. However, regardless of profession, higher pathogen disgust was associated with viewing Krasneeans as less likeable and more unclean. Additionally, regardless of profession, higher pathogen disgust was associated with greater endorsement of group-binding moral values, though healthcare professionals reported greater overall endorsement of group-binding moral values than did control participants.\n\nConclusions and implications: Although healthcare professionals demonstrated lower levels of pathogen disgust, they nevertheless exhibited largely the same relationship between pathogen disgust and interpersonal biases as did control participants. One practical implication of this association is that pathogen avoidance motives may contribute to inequitable patient treatment in healthcare settings.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-06T21:46:13.450716","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Prejudice and Discrimination"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2w9y5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2w9y5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2w9y5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2w9y5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_613"}

The analysis of responses on the RHS-15 scale has shown that depression, anxiety disorders and PTSD were observed among 73% of respondents, whereas 66% of the respondents display psychological distress. The analyses have shown that higher levels of mental health disorders were observed among women and refugees who do not speak Polish. Younger respondents experienced a higher psychological distress. The results of the study also indicate that the refugees more often implemented problem-focused strategies. The analysis has shown that the respondents who followed active strategies scored the lowest on RHS-15. The emotion-focused strategies, such as praying, diverting attention by becoming involved in different activities or taking sedatives were not effective. The highest levels of disorders were present among the refugees who indicated resignation.

Contrasting 5 contemporary DNNs, we evaluated how well each explains human similarity judgements among line drawings of recognizable and novel objects. For object sketches, human judgements were dominated by semantic category information; DNN representations contributed little additional information. In contrast, such features explained significant unique variance perceived similarity of abstract drawings. In both cases, a vision transformer trained to blend representations of images and their natural-language descriptions showed the greatest ability to explain human perceptual similarity\u2014an observation consistent with contemporary views of semantic representation and processing in the human mind and brain.

Auditory rhythms in music range in the complexity of successive tone durations; complex rhythms (based on non-integer duration ratios) are more difficult to perceive and produce than simple rhythms (based on integer ratios). The physiological activity supporting this behavioral difference is not well understood. In a within-subjects design, we addressed how rhythm complexity affects cardiac dynamics during auditory perception and production. Musically trained adults listened to and synchronized with simple and complex auditory rhythms while their cardiac activity was recorded. Participants identified missing tones in the rhythms during the Perception condition and produced finger taps to synchronize with the rhythms in the Synchronization condition. Participants were equally accurate at identifying missing tones in both rhythms during the Perception condition. Tapping synchronization was less accurate and less precise with complex rhythms than with simple rhythms. Linear cardiac analyses showed a slower mean heart rate and greater heart rate variability during perception than production, for both simple and complex rhythms. Individual differences showed that greater heart rate variability was correlated with poorer synchronization. Linear and nonlinear cardiac analyses identified perception \/ synchronization differences; only nonlinear recurrence quantification analyses captured cardiac differences between simple and complex auditory rhythms. Cardiac dynamics were also more deterministic (predictable) during rhythm perception than synchronization. Overall, these findings suggest that cardiac activity is modulated by both task (auditory perception, production) and by rhythm complexity.","tags":["Cardiac rhythms","Rhythm complexity","Recurrence quantification analysis","Auditory-motor synchronisation","Auditory perception"],"date":"2023-02-07T01:23:32.562647","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0293882","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8bs79\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8bs79\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8bs79","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8bs79","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0293882","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_616"}

The study\u2019s results indicate that 29.4% of HCWs have exhibited moderate or higher depressive symptoms, and 10.2% had suicidal ideation. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that being a nurse was associated with higher depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation compared to other HCWs. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis of Polymerase Chain Reaction-positive HCWs showed that being a nurse and the number of COVID-19-related symptoms was associated with high depressive symptoms. These results suggest that HCWs in typical hospitals and nursing homes experiencing major COVID-19 outbreaks are more likely to exhibit severe depressive symptoms, which may worsen if infected with COVID-19. This study\u2019s findings expand the current understanding of HCWs\u2019 depressive symptoms and the importance of psychosocial support during unexpected major outbreaks in healthcare facilities.","tags":["depressive symptom","major outbreak","healthcare worker","suicidal ideation","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-02-07T02:48:39.652605","doi":null,"subjects":["Disruptive, Impulse-control, and Conduct Disorders","Depressive Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/sbm76\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/sbm76\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/sbm76","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/sbm76","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_617"}

Yet, it remains unknown i) whether emotional connotations and structural features of music elicit discrete bodily sensations and ii) whether these sensations are culturally consistent. We addressed these questions by presenting Western (European and North American, n = 589) and East Asian (Chinese, n = 517) participants with silhouettes of human bodies and asked them to indicate the bodily regions whose activity they felt changing while listening to Western and Asian musical pieces with varying emotional and acoustic qualities. The resulting bodily sensation maps (BSMs) varied as a function of the affective qualities of the songs, particularly in the limb, chest, and head regions. Music-induced emotions and corresponding BSMs were robustly replicable across both Western and East Asian subjects. The BSMs clustered similarly across cultures, and cluster structures were similar for BSMs and self-reports of emotional experience. The acoustic and structural features of music were consistently associated with the emotion ratings and music-induced bodily sensations across cultures. These results highlight the importance of somatosensation and interoception in music-induced affective experience and suggest culturally universal associations between musical features, music-induced emotions, and bodily sensations.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-07T06:37:06.159507","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qfyts\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qfyts\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qfyts","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qfyts","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_618"}
{"osf_id":"6h5pk","title":"Attentional priming in Go No-Go search tasks","description":"Go\/No-Go responses in visual search yield different estimates of the properties of visual search than more standard present and absent tasks. Such minor methodological tweaks have a surprisingly large effect on measures that have, for the last half-century or so, formed the backbone of prominent theories of visual attention. Secondly, priming effects in visual search have a dominating influence on visual search, accounting for effects that have been attributed to top-down guidance in standard theories. Priming effects in visual search have never been investigated for Go\/No-Go present\/absent decisions. Here, Go\/No-Go tasks were used to assess visual search for an odd-one-out face, defined either by color or facial expression. The Go\/No-Go responses for the color-based task were very fast for both present and absent and interestingly \u201cGo\u201d responses were even faster for the target absent case. The \u201cGo\u201d responses were, on the other hand, much slower for expression and became higher with increased set-size, particularly for the target-absent response. Priming effects were considerable for the feature search, but for expression, the target absent priming was strong but very weak for target present trials, arguing that repetition priming for this search mainly reflects priming of context rather than target features. Overall, the results reinforce the point that Go\/No-Go tasks are highly informative for theoretical accounts of visual attention, and cast a new light on attentional priming.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-07T07:01:24.001124","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Neuroscience","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6h5pk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6h5pk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6h5pk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6h5pk","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_619"}
{"osf_id":"cjbzu","title":"The emergence of grammatical structure  from inter-predictability","description":"Recent research has shown that words or morphemes that are closer to each other in linear order tend to have higher statistical inter-predictability, measured as mutual information. We offer an explanation for this in terms of holistic chunking of inter-predictable symbols, which provides an efficiency gain in the retrieval of stored symbols to encode a message. Inter-predictable chunking then interacts with structural priming to produce the schematic linear structures that are characteristic of both syntax and morphology. We thus argue that predictability and efficiency play a key role in the emergence of grammatical structure, going beyond previous information-theoretic analyses of natural language. In this paper we articulate some fundamental principles of chunking and linearisation, and use a simple computational implementation to show that these are sufficient to produce natural-language-like structures, using NP-internal ordering as a case study.","tags":["emergent grammar","information theory","syntax"],"date":"2023-02-07T07:34:13.650043","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics","Syntax"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cjbzu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cjbzu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cjbzu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cjbzu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_620"}

Here, in a series of three experiments, we tested the influence of visual and auditory synchrony on attentional selection during a visual foraging task. Experiment 1 was performed online, where the task was to forage for 10 (out of 20) vertical lines among 60 randomly oriented distractor lines that changed color between yellow and blue at random intervals. The targets either changed colors in visual synchrony or not. In another condition, a non-spatial sound additionally occurred synchronously with the color change of the targets. Experiment 2 was run in the laboratory (within-subjects) with the same design. When the targets changed color in visual synchrony, foraging times were significantly shorter than when they randomly changed colors, but there was no additional benefit for the sound synchrony. In Experiment 3, task difficulty was increased as participants foraged for as many 45\u00b0 rotated lines as possible among lines of different orientations within 10 seconds, with the same synchrony conditions as in Experiments 1 and 2. Again, there was a large benefit of visual synchrony but no additional benefit for sound synchronization. Our results provide strong evidence that visual synchronization can guide attention during multiple target foraging. This likely reflects temporal grouping of the synchronized targets. No additional benefit occurred for sound synchrony, even when the foraging task was quite difficult (Experiment 3).","tags":["Cross-Modal Perception","Foraging","visual search","Pip &amp; pop effect","Audition","Synchrony","Perceptual Organization","Grouping"],"date":"2023-02-07T12:25:29.476040","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/73rct\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/73rct\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/73rct","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/73rct","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_621"}
{"osf_id":"v2zg4","title":"Sustained Attention Required for Effective Dimension-Based Retro-Cue Benefit in Visual Working Memory","description":"In visual working memory (VWM) tasks, participants\u2019 performances can be improved through the use of dimension-based retro-cues, which direct internal attention to prioritize a particular dimension (e.g., color or orientation) of VWM representations even after the stimuli disappear. This phenomenon is known as the dimension-based retro-cue benefit (RCB). The present study investigates whether sustained attention is required for the dimension-based RCB by inserting interference or interruption between the retro-cue and the test array to distract attention. We tested the effects of perceptual interference or cognitive interruption on dimension-based RCB when the interference (Experiments 1 and 2 with masks) or interruption (Experiments 3 and 4 with an odd-even task) occurred concurrently with the stages for the maintenance of prioritized information (long cue-and-interference\/interruption interstimulus interval, e.g., Experiments 1 and 3) or the deployment of attention (short cue-and-interference\/interruption interstimulus interval, e.g., Experiments 2 and 4). Our results demonstrate that perceptual interference or cognitive interruption attenuates the dimension-based RCB. These findings suggest that sustained attention is necessary for the effective prioritization of a specific dimension of VWM representations.","tags":["sustained attention","interference","retro-cue benefit","visual short-term memory","dual task","dimension"],"date":"2023-02-07T12:57:31.902820","doi":null,"subjects":["Neuroscience","Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Behavioral Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v2zg4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/v2zg4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/v2zg4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v2zg4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_622"}

{"osf_id":"my4xp","title":"Time-variant gain in noise but not signal in drift-diffusion model leads to slower error decisions","description":"Sequential sampling based mathematical models of decision-making involve evidence accumulation over time during decision formation and have been successful in capturing choice behaviour. A popular model is the drift-diffusion model (DDM). To capture finer aspects of choice behaviour, such as differences in choice reaction times, time-variant gain features that imitate urgency signals have been implemented in standard DDM. In particular, a previous DDM with a time-variant gain can replicate slower error decisions than correct decisions. However, the time-variant gain of the model, and other similar time-variant gain-based models, often implement time-variant gain on both signal and noise features, with the assumption that increasing gain on the drift rate (due to urgency) is similar to DDM with collapsing decision bounds. Hence, it is unclear whether the gain effects on just the signal or noise feature can lead to different choice behaviour. Here, using computational simulations, we used a previous time-variant gain DDM and systemically showed that time-variant gain only on the DDM\u2019s noise suffices to produce slower error choices while time-variant gain only on the drift rate speeds up error choices. In addition, the former was associated with more skewness and kurtosis on correct RT distributions while the latter led to more skewness and kurtosis in error RT distributions. Thus, time-variant gain in DDM\u2019s different components can lead to different choice outcomes, which can potentially be used for more systematic data fitting.","tags":["drift diffusion model","time-variant gain","cognitive computational modelling","perceptual decision making","urgency signal"],"date":"2023-02-07T13:07:53.528418","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Motion Perception","Behavioral Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/my4xp\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/my4xp\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/my4xp","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/my4xp","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_624"}

{"osf_id":"chq5a","title":"Test-retest reliability of reinforcement learning parameters","description":"Recently it has been suggested that parameters estimates of computational models can be used to understand individual differences at the process level. One area of research in which this approach, called computational phenotyping, took hold is computational psychiatry, but it is also used to understand differences in age and personality. One requirement for successful computational phenotyping is that behavior and parameters are stable over time. Surprisingly, the test-retest reliability of behavior and model parameters remains unknown for most experimental tasks and models. The present study seeks to close this gap by investigating the test-retest reliability of canonical reinforcement learning models in the context of two often-used learning paradigms: a two-armed bandit and a reversal learning task. We tested independent cohorts for the two tasks (N=142 and N=154) via an online testing platform with a between-test interval of five weeks. Whereas reliability was high for personality and cognitive measures, it was generally poor for the parameter estimates of the reinforcement learning models. Given that simulations indicated that our procedures could detect high test-retest reliability, this suggests that a significant proportion of the variability must be ascribed to the participants themselves. In support of that hypothesis, we show that mood (stress and happiness) can partly explain within-subject variability. Taken together, these results are critical for current practices in computational phenotyping and suggest that individual variability should be taken into account in the future development of the field.","tags":["reinforcement learning","computational modeling","computational psychiatry","computational phenotyping","test-retest reliability"],"date":"2023-02-07T14:40:38.870596","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Learning","Behavioral Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/chq5a\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/chq5a\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/chq5a","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/chq5a","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_626"}
{"osf_id":"re52c","title":"Equality and Efficiency shape Cooperation in Multiple-Public Goods Provision Problems","description":"The functioning of groups and societies requires that individuals cooperate on public goods such as healthcare and state defense. While psychological science has addressed cooperation and public good provision, it has largely ignored situations in which individuals face multiple public goods and must choose on which to cooperate. Such decisions can be difficult when public goods are attractive on one dimension (e.g., being \u2018efficient\u2019 in providing comparatively high returns) and unattractive on another (e.g., providing unequal rather than equal returns to group members). Here we examined (expectations about) cooperation in multiple-public good provision problems using four incentivized and preregistered experiments (N = 774). Participants simultaneously faced two public goods that varied in efficiency and (in)equality of returns. Results showed more cooperation on the comparatively efficient public good (Exp. 1) and on the equal-return (vs. unequal-return) public good. Crucially, however, when the unequal-returns public good was also the most efficient, individuals cooperated comparatively more on this unequal-but-efficient public good when they themselves benefitted the most from inequality (Exp. 2\u20144). Low beneficiaries largely ignored public good efficiency and preferentially cooperated on equal- rather than unequal-returns public goods. Consequently, groups encountering multiple-public good provision problems including an unequal-but-efficient-returns public good were most cooperative. Expectations (Exp. 2\u20144) as well as preferences for revising the multiple-public good provision problems\u2019 choice architecture (Exp. 3\u20144) echoed these cooperation patterns. We discuss implications for theory and policy on cooperation.","tags":["Decision-Making","Fairness","Social Dilemma","Tragedy of the Commons"],"date":"2023-02-07T14:45:48.426095","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Intragroup Processes"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/re52c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/re52c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/re52c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/re52c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_627"}

As part of this monitoring, staff score patients on various items. Common practice is to aggregate these scores across staff members. However, this is suboptimal because it assumes that assessors are interchangeable and that patients are independent. An improvement over averaging scores is the use of Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT), which imposes a hierarchical model across patients, staff members, and items. While accounting for differences between patients and staff members, CCT estimates a ``true'' score for each patient on each item based on the consensus among staff members. Here we apply a CCT model to data from a Dutch maximum security forensic psychiatric center and use the inferences to predict violent behavior in patients. The CCT model outpredicts several alternatives, such as random forest and boosted regression trees, albeit by a small margin.

(a) Describe our experience with bots using a case study, (b) investigate a wide range of bot detection tactics (BDTs) to establish effectiveness and recommend which BDTs researchers should use, (c) develop a confidence system for eliminating bots to determine how many BDTs researchers should use, and (d) examine the effectiveness of dynamic versus static BDT protocols.\nMethods. This study is part of a larger 14-day experience sampling method (ESM) study examining trauma-exposed lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) women. Faced with several bot infiltrations during data collection, we developed an evolving BDT protocol to eliminate bots and retain participants.\nResults. Throughout the ESM study, the baseline survey received 19,467 responses. After applying our BDT protocols, we eliminated 99.17% of respondents that were likely bots (0.83% usable data). Executing BDTs generated a final sample size of 161. Results of a two-proportions Z-test indicated that some BDTs were more effective than others, some BDTs afforded higher confidence than others, dynamic protocols were more effective than static protocols, and bots introduced significant bias in the results.\nConclusions.

The pathophysiology of ADs is multifaceted and involves intricate connections among biological elements, environmental stimuli, and psychological mechanisms. Recent findings have emphasized the importance of epigenetics in bridging the gap between various risk factors that contribute to ADs and improving our understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying ADs. Epigenetics is the study of how changes in the environment and behavior can have an impact on gene function. Indeed, researchers have found that epigenetic mechanisms can affect how genes either are activated or inactivated, as well as whether they are expressed. Such mechanisms can also influence in both the development and protection of ADs. That is, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been utilized in the majority of pharmacological trials testing epigenetic therapies for the treatment of ADs, showing promising results. In both preclinical and clinical pharmacological trials, HDACi have performed well in the treatment of ADs. In this review, we will present a summary of the current state of knowledge regarding putative risk mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ADs and the role of epigenetic mechanisms acting as potent factors in reducing disorder risk or treating ADs. In addition, we will review the information currently available from preclinical and clinical studies on the use of epigenetic medications to treat ADs.","tags":["DNA Methylation","Histone Modifications","Epigenetic","Anxiety Disorders"],"date":"2023-02-07T16:05:33.117759","doi":null,"subjects":["Physiology","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r7kdz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r7kdz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r7kdz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r7kdz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_630"}

Filtered data from \u2018Survey on lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, out-of-body experiences, and false awakening\u2019 (N = 710) was used to compare sleep duration (SD) with patterns of insomnia (&lt;6 sleep hours) and IH with long sleep (&gt;9 sleep hours).\nResults. rLD was mostly prevalent among the &gt;9 hour SD group (IH, OR 2.8) at 43.3%, in comparison to 29.1% for the &lt;6 hour SD group and 21.1% for the control group. rOBE was most prevalent among the &gt;9 hour SD group (IH, OR 3.0) at 32.1%, in comparison to 17.0% of the &lt;6 hour SD group and 13.6% for the control group. rFA had no OR significance.\nDiscussion. The results show that LD and OBE could be signs of improper SD or even indirect symptoms of sleep disorders like IH with long sleep. The results do not relate to intentional LD practice, as this requires separate research. The outcomes of this study provide an easy means of recognizing deviations in sleep, with potential applications in medicine and in improving quality of life.","tags":["out-of-body experiences","lucid dreams","sleep paralysis","insomnia","idiopathic hypersomnia","false awakening","sleep disorders"],"date":"2023-02-07T16:34:43.112789","doi":"10.13140\/RG.2.2.18870.98889","subjects":["Sleep-wake Disorders","Cognitive Psychology","Psychology, other","Physiology","Consciousness","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x5a36\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x5a36\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x5a36","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x5a36","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.13140\/RG.2.2.18870.98889","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_633"}

{"osf_id":"gbk2j","title":"Coping with Emotional Distress via Self-Disclosure to Robots: Intervention with Caregivers","description":"People often engage in various forms of self-disclosure and social sharing with others when trying to regulate the impact of emotional distress. Here we introduce a novel long-term mediated intervention aimed at supporting informal caregivers to cope with emotional distress via self-disclosing their emotions and needs to a social robot. Research has shown that informal caregivers often struggle in managing the emotional and practical demands of the caregiving situation, and also highlights the lack of social support and paucity of social interaction some experience. Accordingly, we were interested in the extent of informal caregivers' self-disclosure behaviour towards a social robot (Pepper, SoftBank Robotics) over time, and how (social and usability-related) perceptions of the robot develop over time. Moreover, we wished to examine how this intervention made informal caregivers feel (in terms of reported mood, perceptions of the robot as comforting, feelings of loneliness, and stress), and the extent to which interacting with the robot affected these individuals' emotion regulation. Informal caregivers conversed with the social robot Pepper 10 times across 5 weeks about general everyday topics. Our results show that informal caregivers self-disclosed increasingly more to the robot across time and perceived it as increasingly social and competent over time. Furthermore, participants' moods positively changed after interacting with the robot, which they perceived more comforting over time. Participants also reported feeling increasingly less lonely and stressed. Finally, our results showed that after self-disclosing to the robot for 5 weeks, informal caregivers reported being more accepting of their caregiving situation, reappraising it more positively, and experiencing fewer feelings of blame towards others. These results set the stage for situating social robots as conversational partners in social settings, as well as highlight how communicating with social robots holds potential for providing emotional support for people coping with emotional distress.","tags":["Social Robot","Distress","Longitudianal","HRI","Self-Disclosure","Emotion Regulation","Human Robot Interaction","Communication","Informal Care","Well-being"],"date":"2023-02-07T18:12:22.755878","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Perception","Stress","Health Psychology","Health-related Behavior","Embodied Cognition","Well-being","Engineering Psychology","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition","Emotion","Interventions"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gbk2j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gbk2j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gbk2j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gbk2j","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_635"}

Recently, however, increasing interest in predictive processing theories amongst proponents and critics of embodiment alike has raised hopes of a reconciliation. This article sets out to appraise the unificatory potential of predictive processing, focusing in particular on embodied formulations of active inference. Our analysis suggests that most active inference accounts invoke weak, potentially trivial conceptions of embodiment; those making stronger claims do so independently of the theoretical commitments of the active inference framework. We argue that a more compelling version of embodied active inference can be motivated by adopting a diachronic perspective on the way rhythmic physiological activity shapes neural development in utero. According to this visceral afferent training hypothesis, early-emerging physiological processes are essential not only for supporting the biophysical development of neural structures, but also for configuring the cognitive architecture those structures entail. Focusing in particular on the cardiovascular system, we propose three candidate mechanisms through which visceral afferent training might operate: (i) activity-dependent neuronal development, (ii) periodic signal modelling, and (iii) oscillatory network co-ordination.","tags":["Foetal development","Active inference","Embodied cognition","Predictive processing","Interoception","Heart-brain communication"],"date":"2023-02-07T23:53:54.067679","doi":"10.1177\/17456916231185343","subjects":["Developmental Neuroscience","Systems Neuroscience","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mnu8b\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mnu8b\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mnu8b","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mnu8b","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/17456916231185343","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_636"}

To maximize our chances for translational success, we believe researchers must adopt causal inference techniques that augment the causal relevance of estimates given theorized causal structures. To illustrate the utility of incorporating causal inference perspectives into psychoneuroimmunological research, we applied the use of directed acyclic graphs and a combination of empirical and simulated data to demonstrate the consequences of controlling for adiposity when testing the hypothesized association between inflammation and depression under the plausible causal structure of increases in adipose tissue leading to increased inflammation that in turn promotes depression. Effect size estimates were pulled from a dataset combining the Midlife in the United States 2 (MIDUS-2) and MIDUS Refresher datasets. Data were extracted and then used to simulate data reflecting an adiposity -&gt; inflammation -&gt; depression causal structure. Next, a Monte Carlo simulation study with 1,000 iterations and three sample size scenarios (N=100, 250, and 500) was conducted testing whether controlling for adiposity when estimating the relation between inflammation and depression influenced the precision of this estimate. Across all three sample size scenarios controlling for adiposity reduced precision of the inflammation \uf0e0 depression estimate, highlighting the importance of incorporating causal inference approaches into psychoneuroimmunological research.","tags":["causal inferece","immunopsychiatry","depression","inflammation","adiposity","psychoneuroimmunology","BMI"],"date":"2023-02-07T23:56:08.051886","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Health Psychology","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g3huf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/g3huf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/g3huf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g3huf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_637"}

Specifically, a tendency to appraise stressors positively (positive appraisal style; PAS) is theorized to be protective of mental health and thus a key resilience factor. To this date no measures of PAS exist. Here, we present two scales that measure perceived positive appraisal style, one focusing on cognitive processes that lead to positive appraisals in stressful situations (PASS-process), and the other focusing on the appraisal contents (PASS-content).

Results confirm previous research that remote participants using desktop computers can be used effectively for conducting time-critical cognitive experiments. However, inhibition of return was only partially replicated for the VR headset group. Exploratory analyses revealed that technical factors, such as headset type, were likely to significantly impact variability and must be mitigated to obtain accurate results.

To overcome this structural credit-assignment problem, agents have to infer causal structures from experience. Here, we developed a computational model which formalizes action selection as the competition between structural representations, while action control is arbitrated towards the representation that minimizes surprise over time. To validate this model, we recorded behavioral and electrophysiological data from human participants in a novel task in which independent decisions are followed by outcomes, whereby the decision-outcome mapping is unknown. The model could account for patterns of choice behavior revealing clear hallmarks of credit assignment. Model-based analysis of EEG activity confirmed central model characteristics of concurrent prediction errors and a signature of evidence accumulation driving arbitration between representations. These findings highlight a key role of surprise minimization for both value and representation learning and reveal neural correlates of credit assignment.","tags":["surprise","prediction error","credit assignment","reinforcement learning","bandit task","EEG","structure learning"],"date":"2023-02-08T13:07:23.109657","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/kmqp7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/kmqp7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/kmqp7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/kmqp7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_641"}
{"osf_id":"uk7hr","title":"An observational treatment study of metacognition in anxious-depression","description":"Prior studies have found metacognitive biases are linked to a transdiagnostic dimension of anxious-depression, manifesting as reduced confidence in performance. However, previous work has been cross-sectional and so it is unclear if under-confidence is a trait-like marker of anxious-depression vulnerability, or if it resolves when anxious-depression improves. Data were collected as part of a large-scale transdiagnostic, four-week observational study of individuals initiating internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) or antidepressant medication. Self-reported clinical questionnaires and perceptual task performance were gathered to assess anxious-depression and metacognitive bias at baseline and four-week follow-up. Primary analyses were conducted for individuals who received iCBT (n=649), with comparisons between smaller samples that received antidepressant medication (n=82) and a control group receiving no intervention (n=88). Prior to receiving treatment, anxious-depression severity was associated with under-confidence in performance in the iCBT arm, replicating previous work. From baseline to follow-up, levels of anxious-depression were significantly reduced, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in metacognitive confidence in the iCBT arm (B=0.17, SE=0.02, p&lt;0.001). These changes were correlated (r(647)=-0.12, p=0.002); those with the greatest reductions in anxious-depression levels had the largest increase in confidence. While the three-way interaction effect of group and time on confidence was not significant (F(2, 1632)=0.60, p=0.550), confidence increased in the antidepressant group (B=0.31, SE=0.08, p&lt;0.001), but not among controls (B=0.11, SE=0.07, p=0.103). Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression are state-dependent; when symptoms improve with treatment, so does confidence in performance.

In line with model simulations we show that both detection and discrimination expectations influence reaction times on a categorisation task. By combining a no-report version of our task with functional neuroimaging we reveal that content PEs are tracked in posterior sensory cortex while awareness PEs are tracked in prefrontal cortex.

As this framework implies transferring 2-D paradigms to 3-D interactive environments, the risk of losing experimental control, and thus, precision in experimental replicability arises. Therefore, we propose a set of methods to investigate human social cognition in 3-D environments, with an embodied humanoid robot as an integrative tool to overcome replicability issues. To this end, we present two case studies where our methods and tools were applied and replicated across two different laboratories, namely the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova (Italy) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore. In the first case study, we present a replication of an adapted of a gaze cueing paradigm presented by Kompatsiari et al. (2022) developed to investigate the role of eye contact in joint attention. The second case study presents a replication of a paradigm presented by Marchesi et al., (2022), developed to investigate the attribution of mental states to humanoid robots.

{"osf_id":"bhmp2","title":"Self-Explaining Roads: Effects of road design on speed choice","description":"One of the leading principles for road design is the notion of Self-Explaining Roads (SER). According to this notion, the design and layout of the road environment automatically should elicit the behavior that is appropriate for that type of road. The current study investigated the effects of the road environment (i.e., the presence of particular road elements) on driving speed choice in the Netherlands in- and outside the city limits (ICL and OCL). A total of 462 participants (all car drivers) were exposed to either 152 ICL or 152 OCL pictures of road environments for either 300 or 1500 ms and indicated as fast as possible which speed they would drive given the road environment they viewed. All images were labelled with respect to the presence or absence of particular road elements. A linear mixed model was used to determine the effects of road elements on speed choice and response time. The results showed that the presence of particular road elements impacted the speed chosen. For example, inside the city limits, a bicycle lane painted on the road reduced driving speed while a separate bike lane increased the speed chosen. Also, central line markings (relative to no line marking) and a road made of asphalt (relative to pavers) were associated with higher speeds. Outside city limits, having multiple lanes (versus one lane) was related to higher speeds and having two driving directions without separation (versus a one-way road) was related to lower speed choices. Importantly, exposure duration (300 versus 1500 ms) only had a marginal effect, indicating that road users generally only need a brief glimpse of the road to be able to decide what speed to drive. Consistent with the principles of SER, we conclude that categorization and the associated speed decision is fast, operating within a single glance and is impacted by the road elements present in the environment. Finally, we believe our method constitutes a valuable tool in road design, as it allows one to efficiently and effectively gauge the impact of various road elements in large population samples.","tags":["speed choice; self-explaining roads; road design;"],"date":"2023-02-08T15:18:54.454888","doi":null,"subjects":["Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bhmp2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bhmp2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bhmp2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bhmp2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_645"}

Additionally, some studies have examined how trial level fluctuations in speeded reaction time are related to both age and AD. The aim of the current project was to describe patterns of variability across repeated days of testing as a function of AD risk in cognitively normal older adults.\nMethod: The current project examined performance on the Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) smartphone application, a high-frequency remote cognitive assessment paradigm, that administers brief tests of episodic memory, spatial working memory, and processing speed. Bayesian mixed effects location scale models were used to explore differences in mean cognitive performance and intra-individual variability across 28 repeated sessions over a one-week assessment interval as function of age and genetic risk of AD, specifically the presence of at least one APOE \u03b54 allele.\nResults:  Mean performance on processing speed and working memory was negatively related to age and APOE status. More importantly, e4 carriers exhibited increased session level variability on a test of processing speed compared to noncarriers. Age and education did not consistently relate to cognitive variability, contrary to expectations.\nConclusion: Preclinical AD risk, defined as possessing at least one APOE \u03b54 allele, is not only associated with mean-level performance differences, but also with increases in variability across repeated testing occasions. Thus, cognitive variability may serve as an additional and important indicator of AD risk.","tags":["cognition","variability","Alzheimer disease"],"date":"2023-02-08T15:20:14.881840","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/synrd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/synrd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/synrd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/synrd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_646"}

We conclude that people prefer social support matched to their RS attachment orientations and provide recommendations for future research.","tags":["social support","attachment","close relationships"],"date":"2023-02-08T15:35:10.400759","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Interpersonal Relationships"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/mn3js\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/mn3js\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/mn3js","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/mn3js","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_648"}

Although valence ratings were more stable than arousal ratings, we did not observe a significant change in either valence or arousal ratings across the time points. A more detailed look into the data revealed the change in arousal that was different across the valence values. Our analyses demonstrated that, upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, emotionally negative words elicited higher arousal ratings, whereas emotionally positive words elicited lower arousal ratings. It revealed that our participants became more sensitive to the negative content and less sensitive to the positive content. We hypothesized that this pattern could be linked to reduced resilience and consequently could represent a mental health risk.","tags":["lexical norms","emotional valence","arousal","words","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-02-08T15:38:08.923634","doi":null,"subjects":["Linguistics","Cognitive Psychology","Computational Linguistics","Applied Linguistics","Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zxy72\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zxy72\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zxy72","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zxy72","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_649"}

In this paper, we provide an example of one such counter-productive norm, and demonstrate how simple informational interventions can improve behavior. Study 1 shows that among those who recycle, people with stronger prosocial concerns about sustainability are actually worse recyclers \u2014 they err on the side of recycling an item when they unsure if it should be recycled or sent to landfill, and say they would recycle items that are not recyclable. Such \u2018aspirational\u2019 recycling leads to contamination of the recycling stream, increasing the cost of recycling, sometimes to the point that entire batches of recyclable materials are sent to landfill. Unlike traditional public goods problems, this challenge appears to result from lack of information rather than lack of prosocial motivation. Study 2 therefore introduces and tests a simple informational intervention designed to address this counterpro- ductive behavior. Relative to a placebo and a pure control, our intervention significantly reduces the share of respondents who recycle items when they are unsure if they are recyclable, and reduces the number of non-recyclable items that participants say they would recycle. Our findings highlight the importance of unambiguous instructions on how to behave prosocially for effectively promoting public goods.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-08T18:09:48.129235","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9v7aq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9v7aq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9v7aq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9v7aq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_651"}

In this paper, we show that judgments of criticality are intimately linked to considering responsibility. Prospective responsibility attributions in groups are relevant across many domains and situations, and have the potential to influence motivation, performance, and allocations of resources. We develop various models that differ in how the relationship between criticality and responsibility is conceptualized. To test our models, we experimentally vary the task structure (disjunctive, conjunctive, and mixed) and the abilities of the group members (which affects their probability of success). We show that both factors influence criticality judgments, and that a model which construes criticality as anticipated credit best explains participants' judgments. Unlike prior work that has defined criticality as anticipated responsibility for both success and failures, our results suggest that people only consider the possible outcomes in which an individual contributed to a group success, but disregard group failure.","tags":["counterfactuals","criticality","responsibility","causality","pivotality"],"date":"2023-02-08T18:23:34.080489","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Reasoning","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xwm3g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xwm3g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xwm3g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xwm3g","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_652"}

These benchmark effects of word length and frequency are reported in all languages studied to date and inform computational models of eye-movements in reading. This paper asks whether each of these effects is similar in magnitude across languages. We analyzed 12 typologically diverse alphabetic languages from the Multilingual Eye-Movement Corpus (MECO). The languages varied substantially in their word length and frequency distributions as a function of orthographic conventions and the morpho-syntactic type. Despite this variability, the effects of word length and frequency on fixation durations and skipping rate were highly comparable in size between the languages. This finding suggests a high degree of cross-linguistic universality in the readers' behavioral response to visual and linguistic complexity (indexed by word length) and the amount of familiarity with the word (indexed by word frequency). It also suggests feasibility of, and provides empirical data for, generalizable cross-linguistic computational models of eye-movement control in reading.","tags":["cross-linguistic","word length","MECO","word frequency","eye movements"],"date":"2023-02-08T18:48:31.582458","doi":"10.17605\/OSF.IO\/JMTVU","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cbvjr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cbvjr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cbvjr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cbvjr","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17605\/OSF.IO\/JMTVU","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_653"}

{"osf_id":"ec26p","title":"Embedded and Unethical: Why and When Job Embeddedness Facilitates Unethical Behavior","description":"Job embeddedness\u2014the organizational and community forces that anchor employees in their jobs\u2014consistently predicts a wide array of positive outcomes for both individuals and organizations. Still, we question whether high job embeddedness always has normatively desirable effects. Drawing on theories of social identity and organizational climate, we develop a model of why and when embeddedness can motivate unethical behavior. Embedded employees strongly identify with their organization, and thus, we reasoned, are highly motivated to comply with their organization\u2019s social norms. This can inspire embedded individuals to further their organization\u2019s cause through unethical behavior. This is especially likely if they are embedded in a normative climate that privileges organizational interests above all else (i.e., a local egoism climate). We support this model across multiple organizational contexts and empirical methods. We first examined members of terrorist organizations (NTotal = 18,154), finding embeddedness to predict their support for a particularly destructive form of unethical behavior: the use of extreme violence to achieve organizational objectives. We then tested our full theoretical model in a series of preregistered experiments among US employees (NTotal = 5,476). We found that embeddedness causes unethical behavior, and this effect is mediated by norm compliance\u2014but only in a local egoism climate. Encouragingly, more principled climates constrained the deleterious effect of embeddedness by cutting off the relationship between embedded employees\u2019 motivation to comply with norms and their unethical behavior. Collectively, this work advances job embeddedness theory and suggests a means to harness its benefits while curtailing its costs.","tags":["social norms","unethical behavior","job embeddedness","violent extremism","organizational climate"],"date":"2023-02-09T01:10:56.899940","doi":null,"subjects":["Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Organizational Ethics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ec26p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ec26p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ec26p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ec26p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_655"}
{"osf_id":"qv6ew","title":"Children Use Teachers' Beliefs About Their Abilities to Calibrate Explore-Exploit Decisions","description":"Models of the explore-exploit problem have explained how children\u2019s decision making is weighed by a bias for information (directed exploration), randomness, and generalization. These behaviors are often tested in domains where a choice to explore (or exploit) is guaranteed to reveal an outcome. An often overlooked but critical component of the assessment of explore-exploit decisions lies in the expected success of taking actions in the first place \u2013 and, crucially, how such decisions might be carried out when learning from others. Here we examine how children consider an informal teacher\u2019s beliefs about the child\u2019s competence when deciding how difficult a task they want to pursue. We present a simple model of this problem that predicts that while learners should follow the recommendation of an accurate teacher, they should exploit easier games when a teacher overestimates their abilities, and explore harder games when she underestimates them. We tested these predictions in two experiments with adults (Experiment 1) and six- to eight-year-old children (Experiment 2). In our task, participants\u2019 performance on a picture-matching game was either overestimated, underestimated, or accurately represented by a confederate (the \u201cTeacher\u201d), who then presented three new matching games of varying assessed difficulty (too easy, too hard, just right) at varying potential reward (low, medium, high). In line with our model\u2019s predictions, we found that both adults and children calibrated their choices to the Teacher\u2019s representation of their competence. That is, to maximize expected reward, when she underestimated them, participants chose games the Teacher evaluated as being too hard for them; when she overestimated them, they chose games she evaluated as being too easy; and when she was accurate, they chose games she assessed as being just right. This work provides insight into the early-emerging ability to calibrate explore-exploit decisions to others\u2019 knowledge when learning in informal pedagogical contexts.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-09T03:34:32.055286","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Reasoning","Cognitive Development","Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qv6ew\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qv6ew\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qv6ew","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qv6ew","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_656"}

The analysis concluded that sample location and setting did not substantially affect the replicability of findings. In this paper, we raise several issues with the ML2 approach to adjudicating the effect of culture that cast doubt on this conclusion. These theoretical and methodological problems (pre-registered at https:\/\/osf.io\/6exr4) involve the: (1) selection of studies and sample sites for replication that are not theory-driven, (2) sampling of mostly WEIRD people around the world, (3) conflation of participants\u2019 cultural backgrounds with the country where the samples came from, (4) use of the WEIRD backronym by decomposing it into a scale, and (5) application of a mean split of that WEIRD variable. Moreover, simulations reveal strikingly low statistical power for detecting cultural influences in a multi-side study designed like ML2. We propose methodologies to address problems (3) to( 5) by re-analyzing the ML2 dataset using an alternative approach. These results suggest that tackling only some of the design problems is insufficient to overcome the underlying theoretical and methodological deficiencies.

The results showed that individuals who expressed higher traditional place attachment were more opposed towards migrants and war refugees.

This study aims to reveal the COVID-19 vaccine coverage inequality and investigate the predictive effect of attitudes toward science and religion on real-word vaccination uptake. We draw on three high-quality, large-scale databases to unveil real-world vaccine coverage, which stood at an average of 53% of the population by mid-2022. The vaccination rate varies based on a country's income, with higher-income nations having higher vaccination rates and faster vaccination speed. Regression models and a multiverse analysis reveal that both country-level attitudes towards science and religion, as well as religious faith, are linked to vaccination rate at the country level. Countries where a higher proportion of the population prioritize religious beliefs over scientific evidence when the two come into conflict tend to have lower vaccination coverage rates and slower vaccination speeds. These findings suggest that scientists and policymakers must take into account social and cultural characteristics of populations when addressing vaccine inequality.","tags":["science trust","vaccine inequality","religious faith","multiverse analysis","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-02-09T10:18:46.794119","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Health Psychology","Health-related Behavior","Cultural Differences","Cross-cultural Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/geqz3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/geqz3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/geqz3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/geqz3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_660"}
{"osf_id":"62uw7","title":"Development of Measurement Scale and its Reliability and Validity Test of Medical College Students' Medication Literacy","description":"Abstract\nWhat is known and objective: Irrational drug use has become a global problem threatening human health. As future doctors, pharmacists and other relevant professionals, medical college students' medication literacy is also very important, which means the mastery of college students' knowledge to use medicine will directly affect the public's level of medication literacy in the future. The purpose of this study was to develop a medication literacy scale based on the existing health literacy scale and to test its reliability and validity.\nMethods: The initial scale was formed through literature review, and it was modified through expert consultation and student interviews to form the initial scale from March 17, 2020 to May 12. In 2020, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 1283 students in a medical college, from which 1248 valid questionnaires were collected, and 540 samples were drawn according to a certain proportion, which was divided into two equal parts for item analysis, reliability test, validity test, etc.\nResults: The total Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.826(&gt; 0.800), while the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients of functional medication literacy, communicative medication literacy, and critical medication literacy were 0.901, 0.858, 0.851(&gt; 0.800), and the value of half reliability was 0.852 (&gt; 0.800), which indicated that the scale had good internal consistency reliability. Factor analysis of 14 items showed that KMO=0. 852(&gt; 0.7) and Bartlett spherical test P&lt; 0.001, indicating that the data were very suitable for factor analysis. Three principal axis factors were extracted by principal component analysis, and the total variance interpretation rate was 69.031% (&gt;40%). The chi-square freedom ratio \u03c7\u00b2\/df was 2.623&lt; 3(sample size 270), GFI=0.905&gt;0.9(Goodness of Fit index), CFI=0.950&gt;0.9 (Comparative Fit Index), RMSEA=0.078&lt;0.1(Ratio of Chi-square Degrees of Freedom), NFI=0.922&gt;0.9 (Normed Fitindex Standard Fitting Index), TLI=0.938&gt;0.9 (Tucker-Lewis index), all within the acceptable range, indicating that the model fits the survey data as a whole. The model fit is scientific and the effective scale has high validity. The data showed that the average variance of the three dimensions was 0.692, 0.606, 0.578, all of which were greater than 0.5 and the composite reliability was 0.918, 0.884, 0.845, all of which were greater than 0.7, indicating that the scale had high aggregation validity. The square roots of the average variance extraction amount of the three dimensions (the value of diagonal was 0.832, 0.778, 0.760) were greater than the absolute value of the correlation coefficient among the three dimensions (the absolute value of the lower triangle was 0.748, 0.101, 0.037), which shows that the discrimination validity among the three dimensions of the scale is good.\nWhat is new and conclusion: A new scale for evaluating the medication literacy of medical college students was developed in Chinese language preliminarily. The reliability and validity of this scale were verified in the study, suggesting its appropriateness and applicability to measure medication literacy level for Chinese students from medical college from three dimensions: functional medication literacy, communicative medication literacy and critical medication literacy, including 14 items. The medication literacy scale has good reliability and validity and can be used as a preliminary measurement tool for medical students' medication literacy.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-09T11:42:38.749047","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Learning Situation","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/62uw7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/62uw7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/62uw7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/62uw7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_661"}

However, we are on the eve of the mass production of cultured (lab) meat. This alternative to conventional meat should be both more environmentally sustainable and cause less harm to animals, making it more socially acceptable. In this paper, we investigate how people judge investing in meat producers, an issue that has become more salient with the increasing importance of socially responsible investment. We conducted two experimental studies (N=1301) aimed at answering whether people can separate associations towards meat when judging companies that produce them, resolving whether evaluations of meat producers as investment targets have a motivational or affective component, or not. Our findings show that people exhibit an aversion towards investment in both conventional (dconventional=\u20130.97) and cultured meat producers (dcultured=\u20130.26), consistent with the former. Concern for animal welfare exacerbates (dconventional=\u20131.34) or attenuates (dcultured=0.31) this aversion unless people feel disgust-towards animal-flesh, which has a similar adverse effect regardless of meat origin. Our findings suggest that for many, cultured meat producers might remain controversial investment targets. We speculate that similar paradoxical patterns could be observed in other economic decisions, making them socially consequential.","tags":["socially responsible investment","morally controversial stocks","negative screening","sustainable investing","lab meat","meat","sin stocks","cultured meat","socially responsible investing","artificial meat"],"date":"2023-02-09T14:14:49.149014","doi":"10.1016\/j.ecolecon.2023.108094","subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Consumer Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Biases, Framing, and Heuristics","Behavioral Economics","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2bes3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2bes3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2bes3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2bes3","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ecolecon.2023.108094","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_662"}

For each category, we present digital, scalable, automated, and scientifically tested interventions as directly applicable examples. The present framework may make existing scientific findings more accessible and, ultimately, more relevant to practitioners and the digital community, and can provide researchers with starting points for further scientific exploration.","tags":["framework","digital interventions","prosocial behavior","practical","deployment time"],"date":"2023-02-09T15:18:04.904840","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Nudges","Engineering Psychology","Meta-science","Consumer Psychology","Interventions"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ysfm8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ysfm8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ysfm8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ysfm8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_663"}
{"osf_id":"q2ckg","title":"Reframing self-talk in endurance sports using grammatical taxonomy","description":"In this theoretical paper, we use a linguistic vocabulary to reframe self-talk in endurance sport through a focus on grammatical function. Self-talk often works as speech acts, a kind of communicative action, e.g. where a self-talker is using the imperative mood to accomplish some goal with respect to herself (Come on!). Auxiliary modal verbs work across three main types of utterances: Deontic modality involving permission and obligation; dynamic modality involving ability and willingness; epistemic modality involving probabilistic judgements. In self-talk, these all function to establish a hypothetical domain for further reflection. Self-distance can be negotiated using 1st and 2nd person pronouns (I\/you) and spatial demonstratives (this\/that). Sentiment is communicated using adjectives, while negation may yield a means for impulse control. We can question our own utterances and use interjections to communicate surprise. These are all vital mental tools in endurance sports and an increased awareness of their functions in self-talk research will likely yield better self-talk interventions and lead to better performance for athletes.","tags":["endurance sport","inner speech","self-talk","grammar"],"date":"2023-02-09T15:18:39.274770","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q2ckg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/q2ckg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/q2ckg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q2ckg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_664"}
{"osf_id":"tz93w","title":"A sociohistorical model of intersectional social category prototypes","description":"Every person belongs to multiple social categories, such as based on race or ethnicity and gender, yet researchers have traditionally studied beliefs about each of these groups in isolation. Theoretical perspectives have emerged that aim to outline how people\u2019s mental representations of race or ethnicity and gender are systematically intertwined. These intersectional perspectives have been generative, but there remain areas of ostensible disagreement which create conceptual confusion. In this Perspective, we suggest that a sociohistorical approach can help reconcile these differences by highlighting how previous theories offer complementary, rather than conflicting, insights into the structure of social concepts. Specifically, we propose that a sociohistorical model that integrates research across social science fields (history, anthropology, sociology, and psychology) can illuminate how people construct mental representations that align with their surrounding social and cultural systems, which reflect the goals of the dominant gender and ethnic or racial group. By encoding these cultural ideals in mental representations of what members of social categories are like, people\u2019s prototypes reinforce social hierarchies.","tags":["prototypes","race","gender","intersectionality"],"date":"2023-02-09T17:31:13.187580","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Concepts and Categories","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tz93w\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tz93w\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tz93w","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tz93w","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_665"}
{"osf_id":"9ysqx","title":"Topic Analysis Reveals First Impressions of Voices","description":"People form rapid first impressions when encountering novel faces or voices. A popular theory on first impressions suggests there are two dimensions on which voices and faces vary: valence and dominance.  Studies using orthogonal factor rotation, consistently find a third dimension in face space. However, participants are always given the same questionnaire. Unconstrained descriptions of female voices and faces from free-form responses have been tested but rely on researchers\u2019 opinions to categorize descriptions. To shift researcher degrees of freedom away from category membership, we used machine learning to categorize free responses to 50 female and 50 male voices saying \u2018hi\u2019. We found a rich set of features that people use to categorize voices that does not reduce to valence and dominance, suggesting that while these traits are important to researchers, they are not as important to participants.","tags":["Machine Learning","Perception","Dominance","Impressions","Voice","Trust","Valence"],"date":"2023-02-09T17:53:15.689991","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Perception","Impression Formation","Cognitive Psychology","Psychology, other","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9ysqx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9ysqx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9ysqx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9ysqx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_666"}
{"osf_id":"r7chu","title":"Petros Polychronis and the epistemology of life","description":"In living systems, the complex whole that emerges through the multi-level interactions and synergies among the individual constituent parts is able to interact with those parts the very moment they compose it. Depending on the dynamic interplay between them and being in constant dialogue with their wider environment, the whole and the parts are capable of modifying their behavior, adapting, and coevolving. The complex synergies that develop in a far from equilibrium state give rise to a particularly rich and often unexpected collective dynamic behavior. This article is an autoethnographic epistemological inquiry. Through the work and praxis of Petros Polychronis, child psychiatrist, systemic psychotherapist, and director of AKMA for twenty years, and through my relationship with him, I present the main pillars of an epistemology of living systems. The concepts of co-evolution, destabilization, crisis, dissipative structures, strange attractors, bifurcation point, entropy, and rhizome were, among others, for Petros Polychronis not just abstract theoretical conceptions but invaluable practical intervention tools for the empowerment and the sustainability of human systems at the personal and collective level.","tags":["ecoliteracy","complex systems","complexity","systems thinking","epistemology","Petros Polychronis"],"date":"2023-02-09T18:07:57.411963","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Social and Personality Psychology","Developmental Psychology","Educational Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Psychology, other","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r7chu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r7chu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r7chu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r7chu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_667"}

{"osf_id":"9d34r","title":"Do We Need Metacognition for Creativity? A Necessary Condition Analysis of Creative Metacognition","description":"Recent studies suggest that metacognitive knowledge and accurate metacognitive monitoring are associated with higher creativity. However, previous findings were based solely on traditional statistical analyses applying sufficiency causal logic. Necessary condition analysis (NCA) is a novel methodological approach that tests whether a given predictor represents a necessary condition that allows an outcome to exist. Employing NCA, the present study examines whether accuracy of metacognitive monitoring is a necessary condition for creative performance. The study involved 385 participants and tested whether accurate metacognitive monitoring in the Unusual Uses Task was a necessary condition for creative performance in the more complex Product Improvement Task. Two accuracy indices (the Absolute Accuracy Index and Bias Index) were calculated for self-evaluation and comparison judgments. In both cases, the NCA results showed that accurate metacognitive monitoring was a necessary condition for creative performance with a large ceiling effect, median d = .42. This finding suggests that certain levels of metacognitive accuracy are necessary for high creativity to occur; i.e., individuals with inaccurate metacognitive monitoring may not exhibit high creativity. Additional linear and non-linear modeling (regression splines) identified moderate associations between metacognitive monitoring and creativity, with median R2 = 8%.","tags":["creative metacognition","regression splines","monitoring accuracy","necessary condition analysis"],"date":"2023-02-09T18:20:40.196306","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Creativity"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9d34r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9d34r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9d34r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9d34r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_669"}

While poor sleep has been associated with symptoms related to irritability (e.g., anxiety and depression), few studies have directly tested the association between sleep quality and irritability and whether the association is direct or mediated by a separate mechanism. Method: The present study used self-report measures to test whether sleep is associated with trait irritability in 458 adults aged 19\u201374 years (58% female; 79% White), and whether this association is mediated by emotion regulation. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out to support the use of scores from these measures. Results: Controlling for anxiety and depression symptoms, results showed a direct association between poorer sleep quality and increased irritability (\u03b2 = .25, p &lt; .001) that was not mediated by emotion regulation. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the important link between sleep and irritability, both of which are common features of mental health difficulties, prompting further inquiry into the directionality of the findings and potential mediators. This work has notable clinical implications for sleep as a possible intervention target for individuals with high irritability.","tags":["factor analysis","sleep","irritability","emotion regulation"],"date":"2023-02-09T22:32:46.184778","doi":"10.1016\/j.paid.2023.112322","subjects":["Psychology, other","Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/eu2n4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/eu2n4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/eu2n4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/eu2n4","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.paid.2023.112322","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_670"}

In the present research, child participants completed a novel measure designed to test their reactions to another child\u2019s racially discriminatory behavior. The measure presented scenarios in which a protagonist who matched the participant\u2019s race (Asian, Latinx, or White) repeatedly excluded Black children from different social activities. Participants evaluated the protagonist\u2019s behavior and had an opportunity to confront the protagonist. Both a pilot study and a full preregistered study revealed that the novel measure had high reliability within participants and substantial variability across participants (pilot study: N = 54 U.S. White 5\u20137-year-olds, 27 girls, 27 boys, median household income range of $125,001\u2013$150,000; full study: N = 126 U.S. 4\u201310-year-olds, 33.33% Asian, 33.33% Latinx, 33.33% White, 56 girls, 70 boys, median household income: $120,001\u2013$125,000). In the full study, older children and children whose parents reported more racial socialization rated the protagonist\u2019s behavior more negatively; older children were also more likely to confront the protagonist. Neither participants\u2019 own race nor their prior exposure to racial diversity impacted their evaluations or confrontations of discrimination.

The present study explores the clinical potential of whispering by asking whether the benefits of whispering remain stable with short-term use, extend to conversation tasks, and feasible in daily life.\nMethod: Sixteen adult persons who stutter completed tests assessing the amount of stuttering for normal voiced speech and whispering during both conversation and reading aloud tasks. Participants then used whispered communication in their daily lives and reported their subjective experiences. After three weeks, effectiveness tests were repeated.\nResults: Stuttering severity was significantly less for whispered speech (vs. typical speech) during a conversation task (50% reduction) although this effect is smaller than for a reading task (85% reduction). This reduction remained present and comparable in magnitude after three weeks of approximately 5 to 10 minutes daily whispering. Participants subjectively indicated positive experiences with respect to the effects of whispering on fluency and reported whispering helped reduce stuttering-related anxiety. However, four participants (25%) reported negative voice side-effects (e.g., hoarseness, vocal-fold strain), associated with regular whispering.\nConclusions: Occasional use of whispering can effectively reduce stuttering and related behaviors during both reading and conversational speech. This result paves the way for future technological applications that convert whispered speech into natural sounding speech in real-time.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-09T22:48:50.528124","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Health-related Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cgbnd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cgbnd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cgbnd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cgbnd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_672"}

Clinically distressed meditation-na\u00efve participants (n = 351) completed measures of psychological distress, loneliness, empathy, and prosociality at baseline and following a two-week intervention. Informal practice, psychological distress, and loneliness were also assessed daily. Steeper increases in informal practice were correlated with pre-post improvements in distress (r = -.18, p = .008) and loneliness (r = -.19, p = .009) but not empathy or prosociality. Using a currently recommended analytic approach for establishing cross-lagged effects in longitudinal data (latent curve model with structured residuals), higher current-day informal practice was associated with decreased next-day distress but not decreased next-day loneliness. No cross-lagged associations emerged from distress or loneliness to informal practice. Findings suggest that further investigation into a potential causal role of informal practice is warranted.

We investigated whether young children use this fact to infer goals from people\u2019s actions across two experiments on Canadian 3-7-year-olds (total N = 316, 167 girls and 149 boys). Participants\u2019 demographic information was not formally collected, but the region is predominantly middle-class and White. In Experiment 1, 3-year-olds saw a story where one agent went to a gumball machine with mostly red gumballs and another agent went to a machine with mostly purple ones. When asked which agent wanted a red gumball, children mostly selected the agent who chose the mostly-red machine. Moreover, children responded at chance in a control condition where they judged which agent knew they would get a red gumball. In Experiment 2a, 3-7-year-olds saw a story where an agent either chose between two gumball machines or two open bowls of gumballs. In both conditions, the agent chose a location with mostly red gumballs over one with mostly blue gumballs, but ended up with a blue gumball. Children were more likely to infer the agent had wanted a red gumball when the agent had made a probabilistic choice (machines) than a determinative choice (bowls), though inferences that the red gumball was preferred also increased with age. In Experiment 2b, a preregistered follow-up, American adults responded similarly to the older children. Together our findings suggest that children infer goals by drawing on the understanding that people seek favorable odds, though the clearest findings come from children aged 6 years and older.","tags":["choice","preferences","probability","goal inference","desires"],"date":"2023-02-10T04:11:08.358694","doi":"10.1037\/dev0001395","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s23xu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s23xu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s23xu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s23xu","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/dev0001395","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_674"}

In this study, we devised and tested an interpretational framework of nine scenarios to help determine whether perfectionism is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful by comparing the outcomes of excellence and perfection strivers. In a cross-sectional study with university students (N=271; Study 1), we found that perfection strivers savor positive school events less and have greater dropout intentions than excellence strivers. In a prospective\/longitudinal design with college-aged athletes (N=296; Study 2), perfectionism was associated with higher athletic achievement. However, perfection strivers who failed to attain their goals experienced lower savoring and enjoyment than excellence strivers. Our findings highlighted the value of our interpretational scenarios as a hub to facilitate the comparison of MEP findings, while showing how to test MEP hypotheses with five popular statistical analyses. Furthermore, the MEP Shiny App is a valuable contribution to expedite the process of comparing the outcomes of excellence and perfection strivers. Overall, this research forged a substantive-methodological pathway that strengthens and enhances the practicality of the MEP.

In Study 2, in an online chat paradigm, 560 people tended to enjoy interacting with strangers they perceived as prosocial than non-prosocial, but only if they believed the partner to have low income. If they believed the partner to have a high income, whether the partner was perceived to be prosocial or non-prosocial did not influence their enjoyment of the conversation.

This was compared to the current state-of-the-art, a hand-held thermal imaging camera. Although both are actual devices, we used a high fidelity virtual-reality (VR) simulation to provide a safe and controlled, yet realistic, experimental setting. Detecting fire sources was faster with the thermal camera than with the helmet display. Responses in target-present trials were faster than in target-absent trials for both devices. Fire localization after detection was numerically faster and more accurate, in particular in the horizontal plane, for the helmet display than for the thermal camera. Search was strongly biased to start on the left-hand side of each room, reminiscent of pseudoneglect and similar biases in scene viewing.

{"osf_id":"j5abz","title":"Incidental Collocation Learning from Different Modes of Input and Factors That Affect Learning","description":"Collocations, i.e., words that habitually co-occur in texts (e.g., strong coffee, heavy smoker), are ubiquitous in language and thus crucial for second\/foreign language (L2) learners to master. However, previous research shows that L2 learners tend to have limited knowledge of collocations and underuse or misuse them. Given the limited classroom time for deliberately teaching all L2 collocations, incidental learning, i.e., learning while being engaged in meaningful input (e.g., listening, reading, viewing), should play an important role in broadening L2 learners\u2019 collocational knowledge. Nonetheless, to date, there are relatively few studies on incidental collocation learning. In addition, little is known about the effects of different modes of input on incidental collocation learning as well as factors that affect learning. Therefore, the current PhD project was conducted to fill those research gaps. To that end, four empirical studies involving Vietnamese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) were carried out. In each study, participants were exposed to target verb-noun and adjective-noun English collocations in different sets of modes of input (including reading-only, reading-while-listening, reading with textual input enhancement in the form of underlining, reading aloud, and captioned TV viewing) in a counterbalanced fashion. Learning gains in each study were measured with a form recall test on the target collocations administered two times: one week before the treatment (pretest) and one week after the treatment (delayed posttest). Different learner- and item-related factors that might affect learning gains were also examined. Study 1 (Chapter 3) investigated incidental collocation learning from reading-only, reading- while-listening (i.e., reading a book while listening to its audio version), and reading with textual input enhancement (i.e., reading with target items underlined). The results showed that reading with textual input enhancement resulted in significantly more incidental collocation learning than both reading-while-listening and reading-only. Reading-while-listening was more effective for incidental collocation learning than reading-only. Following Study 1, Study 2 (Chapter 4) examined incidental collocation learning from reading-while-listening, reading with textual input enhancement (i.e., underlining), and reading-while-listening plus textual input enhancement to explore if integrating textual input enhancement into reading-while-listening would make a significant difference. The findings revealed that reading with textual input enhancement and reading-while-listening plus textual input enhancement led to significantly more learning gains than reading-while-listening. Reading-while-listening plus textual input enhancement, however, did not differ significantly from reading with textual input enhancement. Study 3 (Chapter 5) looked into incidental collocation learning from reading-while-listening and captioned TV viewing, which differed in terms of the availability of imagery. The results showed that both reading-while-listening and captioned TV led to gains of collocations, but these two modes of input did not differ significantly. Study 4 (Chapter 6) explored incidental collocation learning from reading-only, reading-while-listening, and reading aloud, which were different concerning audio support and vocalization. The results showed that reading aloud and reading-while-listening resulted in significantly more learning gains than reading- only. There was no significant difference between reading aloud and reading-while-listening. With respect to factors that affect learning, all four studies showed that learners\u2019 prior vocabulary knowledge significantly predicted the learning gains (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4). Learners with more vocabulary knowledge were likely to pick up more collocations from reading. As for captioned TV viewing, Study 3 showed that participants with larger vocabularies picked up fewer collocations than those with smaller vocabularies. About collocational congruency (i.e., the availability of first language equivalents of L2 collocations), Studies 1, 2, and 3 showed that this factor was a significant predictor of learning gains. More congruent collocations were incidentally learned than incongruent collocations. Additionally, only Study 4 found that type of collocation affected learning gains, with more adjective-noun collocations being learned than verb-noun collocations, whereas Studies 1, 2, and 3 did not. Other factors, including frequency of exposure, corpus frequency, strength of association (Studies 1 and 2), and test modality (Study 4) did not affect learning gains. The project contributes to advancing our understanding of the effects of input modality on incidental collocation learning and factors that predict learning gains, which can also help relevant stakeholders make informed decisions about L2 vocabulary learning and teaching.","tags":["collocations","English as a foreign language","incidental learning","vocabulary acquisition","second language acquisition"],"date":"2023-02-10T07:55:12.193197","doi":null,"subjects":["First and Second Language Acquisition","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j5abz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j5abz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j5abz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j5abz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_678"}
{"osf_id":"skd3y","title":"Fear of Giving Birth Alone: Experiences of Psychological Distress, Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression, and Coping-strategies of Childbearing Women During COVID-19","description":"Background: Psychological distress experienced during pregnancy is a well-documented risk factor for adverse maternal outcomes. Pandemic-related distress may exacerbate vulnerability to negative mental health outcomes for pregnant women. Aim: To investigate pregnant women's subjective experiences of mental health outcomes, pandemic-related challenges, coping strategies, and positive mental health factors during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods: A mixed-methods study investigated anxiety, depression, and burnout, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding their current experiences with challenges, and buffering factors during the pandemic. Levels of mental health outcomes were calculated, and qualitative data was thematically analyzed. Results: About one-third (24%) of the respondents reported clinically significant levels of depression, 19% reported clinically significant levels of anxiety and 43% reported being burned out. Distress, fear, and worry related to several pandemic-related factors were reported by all of the women, including fear of giving birth alone, fear of the consequences of lockdown restrictions, insufficient information, disruption of prenatal healthcare services, and fear of miscarriage. Social support, financial stability, stable relationships, following daily routines, less stress and a calmer daily life, less social demands, physical activity, as well as less work-related stress and working from home, were experienced as buffering factors that helped the women to cope with the distress associated with the pandemic lockdown. Conclusion: Healthcare providers should emphasize the importance of ensuring stability, predictability, minimizing disruptions to prenatal care and offering broad-based screening to identify women at risk of depression and anxiety. Recommendations for clinical pathways aimed at pregnant women are discussed.

{"osf_id":"se3fa","title":"Lonely today, lonely tomorrow: Temporal dynamics of loneliness in everyday life and its associations with psychopathological symptoms","description":"Although theory emphasizes that loneliness fluctuates in everyday life, most previous studies focused on the general and stable tendency of feeling lonely. In the present study, we used daily diary data collected over two 4-weeks periods (N1 = 3,309; N2 = 907) to examine different indicators of temporal dynamics of loneliness in everyday life and compare them to temporal dynamics of positive and negative affect. Moreover, we examined associations between temporal dynamics of loneliness and psychopathological symptoms (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression). We found large similarities in the variability, instability, and inertia of loneliness and affect. Moreover, all indicators of temporal dynamics of loneliness were related to psychopathological symptoms. However, these indicators had little added value above the average state and trait level of loneliness in predicting psychopathology. We discuss the potential of assessing the short-term dynamics of loneliness for the early detection of mental health issues.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-10T11:39:35.803967","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/se3fa\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/se3fa\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/se3fa","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/se3fa","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_680"}

Potential aggravating factors are level of linguistic skills and impairments in auditory temporal processing. Here, we investigated autistic adolescents with and without language delay as compared to non-autistic peers, and we assessed speech perception in steady-state noise, in temporally modulated noise, and in concurrent speech. We found that autistic adolescents with intact language capabilities and not those with language delay performed worse than NT peers on words-in-stationary-noise perception. For the perception of sentences in stationary noise we did not observe significant group differences, although autistic adolescents with language delay tend to perform poorer in comparison to their TD peers. We also found evidence for a robust deficit in speech-in-concurrent-speech processing in ASD independent of language ability, as well as an association between early language delay in ASD and inadequate temporal speech processing. We propose that reduced voice stream segregation and inadequate social attentional orienting in ASD result in disproportional informational masking of the speech signal. These findings indicate a severe speech-in-speech processing deficit in autistic adolescents with broad implications for quality of social communication.","tags":["speech perception","speech in noise","language disorders","Autism spectrum disorder","behavioural research","temporal processing"],"date":"2023-02-10T12:23:13.075112","doi":"10.1002\/aur.2966","subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c36z4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/c36z4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/c36z4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c36z4","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/aur.2966","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_681"}

Developing and validating the Adolescent Radicalization Outcomes Questionnaire (AROQ)","description":"The process of radicalization is often discussed and investigated without a clear outcome definition, as is the similar concept of extremism; moreover, research is usually conducted on adults, despite studies pointing to adolescence as the crucial time during which radicalization processes develop. Building upon previous literature, we propose three possible outcomes of the radicalization process: benevolent radicalism, malevolent radicalism, and extremism. To operationalize these outcomes, we develop a questionnaire measuring four constructs, namely political violence legitimization, political and religious (in-)tolerance, political system preference, and ingroup superiority beliefs. We developed an instrument specifically suitable for adolescents, using n = 1260 German-speaking adolescents (13-20 years) in item development and n = 622 in scale testing and validation. The resulting 61 items and five scales were developed and validated through a combination of item analysis, cognitive interviewing, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Support was found for each of the five scales in terms of reliability, discriminant and concurrent validity. We therefore found the Adolescent Radicalization Outcomes Questionnaire to be a valid and reliable instrument.","tags":["extremism","measurement","adolescence","radicalism","scale development","scale validation","radicalization"],"date":"2023-02-10T13:01:54.679548","doi":null,"subjects":["Adolescence","Social and Personality Psychology","Developmental Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Psychometrics","Violence and Aggression","Politics","Attitudes and Persuasion","Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qs2nu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qs2nu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qs2nu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qs2nu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_682"}

In this piece, we complete a high-level review of psychology-centered work published in Mobile Media &amp; Communication (MMC). Our \u201cflyover review\u201d affirms that MMC represents a key watering hole for exploring \u2013 and debating \u2013 the novel psychological implications of mobile technologies. We identify 57 articles across the 10-year history of MMC that are framed around established psychological concepts. Among this sub-sample of articles, we then extract four key themes: 1) psychological predictors of general usage, 2) psychological dynamics of online\/offline contexts, 3) psychological well-being and alarmism, and 4) psychological dis\/connection to mobile media. Following the review, we ponder the trajectory of psychological research on mobile media, including where it is published and how it can be integrated across fields given its discipline-bending nature. We argue the body of psychological research in MMC is highly phenomenological and correlational, resulting in theoretical fragmentation and limited evidence for mobile media effects. Nonetheless, we suggest Mobile Media &amp; Communication is best positioned to sync the scattered literature on the psychology of mobile media.","tags":["mobile technology","smartphones","phones","effects","devices","psychology","cyberpsychology","apps"],"date":"2023-02-10T13:28:57.096218","doi":"10.1177\/20501579221134369","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5jykh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5jykh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5jykh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5jykh","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/20501579221134369","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_683"}
{"osf_id":"rwa57","title":"Expectations underlie the effects of unpredictable pain: a behavioral and EEG study","description":"Previous studies on the potential effects of unpredictability on pain perception and its neural correlates yielded divergent results. This study examined whether this may be explained by differences in acquired expectations. We presented 41 healthy volunteers with laser heat stimuli of different intensities. The stimuli were preceded either by predictable low, medium or high cues or by unpredictable low-medium, medium-high or low-high cues. We recorded self-reports of pain intensity and unpleasantness and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). Furthermore, we investigated whether dynamic expectations that evolved throughout the experiment based on past trials were better predictors of pain ratings than fixed (non-evolving) expectations. Our results replicate previous findings that unpredictable pain is higher than predictable pain for low-intensity stimuli but lower for high-intensity stimuli. Moreover, we observed higher ratings for the medium-high unpredictable condition than the medium-low unpredictable condition, in line with an effect of expectation. We found significant interactions (N1, N2) for the LEP components between intensity and unpredictability. However, the few significant differences in LEP peak amplitudes between cue conditions did not survive correction for multiple testing. In line with predictive coding perspectives, pain ratings were best predicted by dynamic expectations. Surprisingly, expectations of reduced precision (increased variance) were associated with lower pain ratings. Our findings provide strong evidence that (dynamic) expectations contribute to the opposing effects of unpredictability on pain perception, therefore, we highlight the importance of controlling for them in pain unpredictability manipulations. We also suggest to conceptualize pain expectations more often as dynamic constructs incorporating previous experiences.","tags":["Bayesian inference","unpredictability","pain","expectations","EEG","predictive coding"],"date":"2023-02-10T13:47:47.976522","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rwa57\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rwa57\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rwa57","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rwa57","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_684"}
{"osf_id":"bw5xk","title":"Does attributing mental states to a robot influence accessibility of information represented during reading?","description":"When we read fiction, we encounter characters that interact in the story. As such, we encode that information and comprehend the stories. Prior studies suggest that this comprehension process is facilitated by taking the perspective of characters during reading. Thus, two questions of interest are whether people take the perspective of characters that are not perceived as capable of experiencing perspectives (e.g., robots), and whether current models of language comprehension can explain these differences between human and nonhuman protagonists (or lack thereof) during reading. The study aims to (1) compare the situation model (i.e., a model that factors in a protagonist\u2019s perspective) and the RI-VAL model (which relies more on comparisons of newly acquired information with information stored in long term memory) and (2) investigate whether differences in accessibility of information differ based on adopting the intentional stance towards a robot. To address the aims of our study, we designed a preregistered experiment in which participants read stories about one of three protagonists (an intentional robot, a mechanistic robot and a human) and answered questions about objects that were either occluded or not occluded from the protagonist\u2019s view. Based on the situation model, we expected faster responses to items that were not occluded compared to those that were occluded (i.e., the occlusion effect). However, based on the RI-VAL model, we expected overall differences between the protagonists would arise due to inconsistency with general world knowledge. The results of the pre-registered analysis showed no differences between the protagonists, nor differences in occlusion. However, a post-hoc analysis showed that the occlusion effect was shown only for the intentional robot but not for the human, nor mechanistic robot. Results also showed that depending on the age of the readers, the RI-VAL or the situation model is able to explain the results such that that older participants \u201csimulated\u201d the situation about which they read (situation model), while younger adults compared new information with information stored in long-term memory (RI-VAL model). This suggests that comparing to information in long term memory is cognitively more costly. Therefore, with older adults used less cognitively demanding strategy of simulation.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-10T14:45:39.546582","doi":"10.1016\/j.actpsy.2022.103660","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Concepts and Categories"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bw5xk\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bw5xk\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bw5xk","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bw5xk","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.actpsy.2022.103660","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_685"}

This study evaluated whether two different psychological constructs, moral reasoning and moral competence, are associated with cooperative behavior in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game, a two-person social dilemma where individuals choose between cooperation or defection. One hundred and eighty-nine Mexican university students completed the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2; measuring moral reasoning) and the Moral Competence Test (MCT) and played an online version of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, once against each participant in a group of 6 to 10 players. Our results indicate that cooperative behavior is strongly affected by the outcomes in previous rounds: Except when both participants cooperated, the probability of cooperation with other participants in subsequent rounds decreased. Both the DIT-2 and MCT independently moderated this effect of previous experiences, particularly in the case of sucker-outcomes. Individuals with high scores on both tests were not affected when in previous rounds the other player defected while they cooperated. Our findings suggest that more sophisticated moral reasoning and moral competence promote the maintenance of cooperative behaviors despite facing adverse situations.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-10T17:51:37.925719","doi":"10.1038\/s41598-023-30314-7","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Moral Behavior","Judgment and Decision Making","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Reasoning","Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition","Prosocial Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/atb6q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/atb6q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/atb6q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/atb6q","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41598-023-30314-7","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_690"}

The aim of this study is to revise the Chinese version of the MRBQ in a sample of young adult riders and test the mediating role of sensation seeking. We recruited 278 online participants in Beijing, China, and required them to fill out the Big Five Inventory measuring the Big Five personality traits, the sensation seeking scale, MRBQ, and self-reported traffic violations from the traffic management system (crashes, traffic violation frequency, penalty points, and fines). Exploratory factor analysis suggested 7 factors (safety equipment, traffic errors, speed violations, control errors, stunts, traffic violations, and safety violations), and the internal consistent reliability ranged from 0.58\u20130.91. The hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that agreeableness and conscientiousness negatively predicted the total MRBQ score, while openness and sensation seeking positively predicted the total MRBQ score.

In the current study we used a bottom-up approach to create a large population-specific lexicon of personality terms. We subsequently examined the overlap and sensitivity to extract implicit personality of this dictionary compared to an established trait dictionary in the same language. Overall, we found that the two dictionaries only showed limited overlap with a pronounced divergence in emotionality (Neuroticism) and social aspects (Agreeableness) of personality. In addition to this, we found that while the implicit personality extracted from self-descriptions using the established dictionary showed alignment with participants self-rated personality, especially in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, the population-specific dictionary showed a significantly greater alignment between implicit and self-rated personality. In summary, our current study highlights the need to extend our thinking about the psycholexical hypothesis, moving away from assumptions of time invariant language encoding to more explicitly recognizing the temporal dynamics underpinning the expression and use of personality trait terms.","tags":["implicit personality","lexical hypothesis","text mining","Big Five","population specific dictionary"],"date":"2023-02-11T14:43:38.256593","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Psychology, other","Theories of Personality","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/muyc2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/muyc2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/muyc2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/muyc2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_697"}

{"osf_id":"97pdj","title":"Effects of an Artificial Intelligence Platform for Behavioral Interventions on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms: Randomized Clinical Trial","description":"Background: The need for scalable delivery of mental health care services that are efficient and effective is now a major public health priority. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to improve behavioral healthcare services by helping clinicians collect objective data on patients\u2019 progress, streamline their workflow, and automate administrative tasks.\nObjective: To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an AI platform for behavioral health in facilitating better clinical outcomes for patients receiving outpatient therapy.\nMethods: The study was conducted at a community-based clinic in the U.S. Participants were 47 adults referred for outpatient, individual cognitive behavioral therapy for a main diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder. The platform provided by Eleos Health compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) during the first two months of therapy. This AI platform summarizes and transcribes the therapy session, provides feedback to therapists on the usage of evidence-based practices (EBPs), and integrates these data with routine standardized questionnaires completed by patients. The information is also used to draft the session\u2019s progress note. Patients were randomized to receive either therapy provided with the support of an AI platform developed by Eleos Health or TAU at the same clinic. Data analysis was carried out based on intention-to-treat from December 2022 to January 2023. The primary outcomes included the feasibility and acceptability of the AI platform. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scores as well as treatment attendance, satisfaction, and perceived helpfulness.  \nResults: Seventy-two patients were approached, of whom 47 (67%) agreed to participate. Participants were adults (34 [72.34%] women and 13 [27.65%] men; mean [SD] age was 30.64 [11.02] years old), 23 randomized to the AI platform group, and 24 to TAU. Participants in the AI group attended, on average, 67% more sessions (n = 5.24, SD = 2.31) than those in TAU (n = 3.14, SD = 1.99). Depression and anxiety symptoms were reduced by 34% and 29% in the AI platform group versus 20% and 8% for TAU, respectively, with large effect sizes for the therapy delivered with the support of the AI platform. No group difference was found in 2-month treatment satisfaction and perceived helpfulness. Further, therapists using the AI platform submitted their progress notes, on average, 55 hours earlier than therapists in the TAU group (t = -.73, p &lt; .001). \nConclusions: In this RCT, therapy provided with the support of Eleos Health demonstrated superior depression and anxiety outcomes as well as patient retention, compared with TAU. These findings suggest that complementing the mental health services provided in community-based clinics with an AI platform specializing in behavioral treatment was more effective in reducing key symptoms than standard therapy. \nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05745103","tags":["Community-based Centers","Depression","Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy","Anxiety","Evidence-based Practices","AI-augmentation","Artificial Intelligence","Health force burnout"],"date":"2023-02-11T23:07:16.912635","doi":null,"subjects":["Therapy","Psychotherapy","Mental Disorders","Depressive Disorders","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/97pdj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/97pdj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/97pdj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/97pdj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_700"}

We take a step toward addressing this issue by developing a framework of approaches for delivering interventions to an unmotivated target audience. Along with (1) directly motivating targets by increasing their values and expectancies for addressing intergroup conflict, researchers can deliver interventions by (2) satisfying other psychological motivations of the target audience, (3) providing an instrumental benefit for engaging with the intervention, (4) embedding the intervention in a hedonically captivating medium, or (5) bypass motivational barriers entirely by delivering the intervention outside of targets\u2019 conscious awareness.

{"osf_id":"umd7w","title":"How to Obtain Aesthetic Preference for Visual Artworks Eliciting Negative Valence: Eye Fixation on Semantic Cues and Improved Conceptual Fluency","description":"It is unique humanity to exhibit an aesthetic preference for displeasing artworks. Although prior works explained this with processing fluency, there is space for theoretical and methodological elaboration. Through two experiments, we aim to disentangle the distinguishable contribution of conceptual fluency in preference for artworks eliciting negative valence from the role of perceptual fluency. We manipulated conceptual fluency by semantic priming (experiment 1), and perceptual one via controlling visual contrast (experiment 2). We measured perceivers' valence, preference, and subtypes of fluency for artworks inducing various valence. With these data, the hedonic and amplifying effects of fluency in aesthetic preference were tested. Also, we recorded their eye movement during art appreciation to precisely capture their processing style varying on the level of fluency. Results of both experiments support that only conceptual fluency directly and indirectly affects art preference. It directly increased preference and attenuated inhibitory effects of negative valence on art preference. This suggests that the amplifying model for fluency does not fit the context of art appreciation. Furthermore, eye tracking analysis revealed that all groups performed automatic processing regardless of contrast level in experiment 2. However, the primed group conducted controlled processing, unlike the not-primed group in experiment 1. With the pleasure- interest model of aesthetic liking ('PIA model', Graf &amp; Landwehr, 2015), this result emphasizes the role of conceptual fluency via semantic priming in aesthetic preference. Generally, our study purposed to refine the amplifying theory of processing fluency and the PIA model to underpin their potential in empirical aesthetics.","tags":["negative valence","conceptual fluency","empirical aesthetics","aesthetic preference","eye tracking"],"date":"2023-02-12T03:41:04.466064","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/umd7w\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/umd7w\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/umd7w","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/umd7w","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_702"}

Cognitive reappraisal, the process of reinterpreting negative emotion stimuli, is the most widely studied and effective emotion regulation (ER) strategy. Natural language processing (NLP) metrics have emerged as a way of understanding emotions and could also help understand ER via reappraisal. We explored the combination of theory-relevant NLP metrics indexing emotionality, self-referential focus, cognitive inflexibility (\u201ccertainty\u201d), and avoidant coping (\u201caction\u201d) to understand (1) ER during reappraisal, (2) individual differences in ER, and (3) shorter, 2-week, and longer-term, 8-week, internalizing symptoms. Methods: Individuals with a history of psychopathology (N=409) participated in a randomized controlled trial. We analyzed text and self-report data from the cognitive restructuring portion of the interventions. The text was analyzed with Sentiment Analysis aNd social Cognition Engine (SEANCE), which pools together scores from various NLP algorithms. Results: Following reappraisal, there were large reductions in self-references and negative language with smaller increases in action and certainty. The SEANCE metrics did not appear to correlate with self-reported improvements during the task. However, self-reported reappraisal was associated with larger changes in SEANCE-certainty during the task. These changes in SEANCE-certainty also showed predictive validity in relation to well-being and internalizing symptoms in the shorter-term symptoms. Discussion: NLP metrics may capture individual differences in reappraisal, and some, but not all, aspects of the process. Consistent with theory, changes in NLP-measured certainty may capture an important aspect of reappraisal.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-12T19:13:57.385787","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Psychotherapy","Quantitative Methods","Quantitative Psychology","Diagnosis","Depressive Disorders","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/9mek5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/9mek5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/9mek5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/9mek5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_707"}

Terror Management Theory (TMT) argues that pursuing the \u2018thin ideal\u2019 may be one way that women can defend against fears of death. The present study used the mortality salience (MS) paradigm to examine whether priming death would increase disordered eating behaviours and attitudes. We recruited two samples of 128 women from analogue (Study 1), and clinically relevant (Study 2) populations. Participants were randomised to either a MS or control condition. Following priming, participants completed a portion size estimation task, two measures of body dissatisfaction, and an intention to eat item. The results from Study 1 were inconsistent with the claimed role of death anxiety in disordered eating. However, in Study 2, MS priming led to increased dissatisfaction with current thinness and smaller portion sizes for high-fat food compared to low-fat food, but not other outcomes.

{"osf_id":"u6nj8","title":"Expectation-driven and experience-driven attention interactively influence product searching: the moderating role of working memory capacity","description":"Consumers selectively focus their attention on the target and ignore irrelevant information according to their expectations when searching for products. For instance, consumers search for target flavor packages that are incongruent (vs. congruent) with their color expectations formed based on long-term experience more slowly and inaccurately, which is also known as the color-flavor incongruency effect. However, the effect of conflicting information on task performance varies with the frequency of conflict, and there are both expectation-driven and experience-driven mechanisms underlying the adjustment of attention in different task contexts. In addition, individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) moderate the expectation-driven attentional control strategy. Here, we report three experiments designed to examine whether the presence or absence of precues of different proportion congruence (i.e., mostly congruent or mostly incongruent; MC or MI) can alter participants\u2019 product search performance based on color expectations and whether individual WMC differences moderate this effect. Experiment 1 found that the magnitude of the color-flavor incongruency effect was interactively influenced by expectation- and experience-driven attentional control strategies. For MC blocks, this effect was larger in the cued (vs. uncued) condition. In contrast, for MI blocks, there was no difference in the size of the color-flavor incongruency effect in the two conditions. Experiment 2 extended the interactive effect of the two attentional control strategies on the product search based on expectation to a real shopping scenario simulated by using virtual reality technology. Experiment 3 further discovered that the size of the color-flavor incongruency effect decreased with increasing WMC in the MI-cued condition where the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was 1500 ms.

{"osf_id":"7trmf","title":"The labels and models used to describe problematic substance use impact discrete elements of stigma: A Registered Report","description":"Objectives: Problematic substance use is one of the most stigmatised health conditions leading research to examine how the labels and models used to describe it influence public stigma. Two recent studies examine whether beliefs in a disease model of addiction influence public stigma but result in equivocal findings \u2013 in line with the mixed-blessings model, Kelly et al. (2021) found that whilst the label \u2018chronically relapsing brain disease\u2019 reduced blame attribution, it decreased prognostic optimism and increased perceived danger and need for continued care; however, Rundle et al. (2021) conclude absence of evidence. This study isolates the different factors used in these two studies to assess whether health condition (drug use vs. health concern), aetiological label (brain disease vs. problem), and attributional judgement (low vs. high treatment stability) influence public stigma towards problematic substance use. Methods: 1613 participants were assigned randomly to one of eight vignette conditions that manipulated these factors. They completed self-report measures of discrete and general public stigma and an indirect measure of discrimination. Results: Greater social distance, danger, and public stigma but lower blame were ascribed to drug use relative to a health concern. Greater (genetic) blame was reported when drug use was labelled as a \u2018chronically relapsing brain disease\u2019 relative to a \u2018problem\u2019. Findings for attributional judgement were either inconclusive or statistically equivalent. Discussion: The labels used to describe problematic substance use appear to impact discrete elements of stigma. We suggest that addiction is a functional attribution, which may explain the mixed literature on the impact of aetiological labels on stigma to date.","tags":["discrimination","vignettes","addiction","brain disease model","stigma","models of addiction","problematic substance use"],"date":"2023-02-13T07:54:32.059317","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7trmf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7trmf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7trmf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7trmf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_712"}

Despite its popularity, there is little evidence of the ability of this model to recover latent dynamics when the latent trajectories are affected by stochastic innovations (i.e., dynamic error). The deterministic specification of the BLCS model does not account for the effect of these innovations in the system. In contrast, the stochastic specification of the BLCS model includes parameters that capture the effect of such innovations at the latent level. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we generated two developmental processes and examined the recovery of the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic BLCS models under a broad range of empirically relevant conditions. Based on our findings, we provide specific guidelines and recommendations for the application of BLCS models in developmental research.  https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10705511.2022.2161906","tags":["structural equation models","latent change score model","stochastic innovations","longitudinal data analysis","stochastic dynamical systems"],"date":"2023-02-13T09:02:31.888636","doi":"10.1080\/10705511.2022.2161906","subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h6pfw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h6pfw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h6pfw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h6pfw","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10705511.2022.2161906","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_713"}
{"osf_id":"6wjpb","title":"A Dynamic Approach to Control for Cohort Differences in Maturation Speed Using Accelerated Longitudinal Designs","description":"Accelerated longitudinal designs (ALD) allow studying developmental processes usually spanning multiple years in a much shorter time framework by including participants from different age cohorts, which are assumed to share the same population parameters. However, different cohorts may have been exposed to dissimilar contextual factors, resulting in different developmental trajectories. If such differences are not accounted for, the generating process will not be adequately characterized. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time latent change score model as an approach to capture cohort differences affecting the speed of maturation of psychological processes in ALDs. This approach fills an important gap in the literature because, until now, no method existed for this goal. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation study, we show that the proposed model detects cohort differences adequately, regardless of their size in the population. Our proposed model can help developmental researchers control for cohort effects in the context of ALDs.  https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10705511.2022.2163647","tags":["cohort differences","continuous time models","accelerated longitudinal designs","state space models","speed of maturation","latent change score models"],"date":"2023-02-13T09:07:52.735570","doi":"10.1080\/10705511.2022.2163647","subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6wjpb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6wjpb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6wjpb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6wjpb","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10705511.2022.2163647","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_714"}

Yet, these critical aspects of social identity are barely mentioned in the study of intergroup psychology. We attempt to address this gap. Arranged into four mutually exclusive classes known as varnas, further subdivided into more specific categories termed Jatis, South Asian caste boundaries are complex, intertwined with religious doctrines, and vary across geographies. Moreover, caste discrimination against lower-caste groups, like the Dalits, is relatively acceptable. This acceptability contrasts with the assumption of prevailing anti-discrimination norms that characterize the psychological research of many other biases, such as racial bias in contemporary U.S. society. Caste boundaries are also firmly rooted in notions of purity, and one's caste membership is not usually evident at a glance. We outline an agenda for understanding and combating casteism that involves exploring the social, cognitive, and emotional factors that contribute to caste-based bias, the ways caste intersects with other identities, whether and how people recognize caste discrimination, the measurement of caste-based bias, and strategies to counteract casteism and its discriminatory effects. Intergroup psychology would be improved from the study of these issues \u2013 as would the lives of the millions of people affected by caste-based bias.","tags":["caste","discrimination","psychology","intergroup bias","social inclusion"],"date":"2023-02-13T10:23:05.516058","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Prejudice and Discrimination"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/g39t2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/g39t2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/g39t2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/g39t2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_715"}

The role of epistemic emotions and perceived credibility in the relation between prior beliefs and susceptibility to fake-news","description":"The present research examines processes involved in how people believe and share news posts on social media. We tested whether the relation between individuals' previous political beliefs and judging the accuracy of and willingness to share fake and true news is mediated by epistemic emotional response (surprise and interest) and perceived credibility (trustworthiness, rigorosity, impartiality). In a within-subjects experiment, we presented ten publications (5 true, 5 fake) with political content, extracted from Facebook, to 259 Portuguese participants. The results showed that fake and true news were processed in a similar way. Emotional response and perceived credibility did not only depend on the content, but also on previous beliefs. Negative beliefs about the political system increased emotional response to true and false news, which in turn increased perceptions of credibility, leading to higher accuracy attributions and willingness of sharing news (true or false). The most distinctive difference between the participants interactions with fake and true news was that participants willingness to share fake news was not entirely explained by emotional response and credibility perceptions. We conclude that people seem to rely on emotional cues, appraised with regard to previous beliefs, and on emotionally biased credibility indicators to guess whether news are true or worth sharing.","tags":["misinformation","bayesian approach","beliefs","fake news","perceived credibility","classical account","emotions","structural equation model","motivated account"],"date":"2023-02-13T13:43:25.542141","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/uz8p7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/uz8p7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/uz8p7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/uz8p7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_719"}

We aimed to evaluate how visual processing strategies (i.e., eye movement patterns) directly support encoding and recognition of faces in autistic and neurotypical (NT) individuals. Methods: We used a hidden Markov modeling approach to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of eye movements in autistic (n = 15) and neurotypical (NT) adolescents (n = 17) during a face identity recognition task.\nResults: We discovered distinct eye movement patterns among all participants, which included a focused and exploratory strategy. When evaluating change in visual processing strategy across encoding and recognition phases, autistic individuals did not shift their eye movement patterns like their NT peers, who shifted to a more exploratory visual processing strategy during recognition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that autistic individuals do not modulate their visual processing strategy across encoding and recognition of faces, which may be an indicator of less efficient face processing.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-13T15:21:03.306144","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nx7da\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nx7da\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nx7da","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nx7da","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_720"}

First, we lay out some pieces along the puzzle edge, such as computational tradeoffs inherent to neural architectures that give rise to rational bounds of cognition. We then outline critical next steps for characterizing cognitive bounds, proposing that some of these bounds can be subject to modification by cognition and, as such, are part of what is being optimized when cognitive agents decide how to allocate cognitive resources. We conclude that these emerging views may contribute to a more holistic perspective on the nature of cognitive bounds, as well as their alteration subject to cognition.","tags":["multitasking","meta-reasoning","learning","bounded rationality","cognitive constraints","cognitive control","rational inattention","neural networks"],"date":"2023-02-13T15:37:58.189434","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Attention","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ndfwt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ndfwt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ndfwt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ndfwt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_721"}
{"osf_id":"8k76z","title":"Suspending the embodied self in meditation attenuates beta oscillations in posterior medial cortex","description":"Human experience is imbued by the implicit sense of being an embodied agent, differentiated from but acting on an external world. Because this basic, embodied sense of self is both pervasive and implicit (i.e., pre-reflective), its investigation requires broad means of manipulation, as well as rigorous first-person methodology for mapping ensuing subjective changes, in parallel to neuroscientific monitoring. Here we show that advanced meditative states, embedded within a neurophenomenological design combining brain recordings and principled phenomenological interviewing techniques can be leveraged to that end: Forty-six long-term meditators were trained in modulating their embodied self-experience by dissolving their sense of boundaries. The induced states were monitored with magnetoencephalography and subjective changes were mapped using phenomenological interviews. Hypotheses were pre-registered and researchers blinded during data analysis. Results demonstrated high beta-band oscillatory power reductions in frontoparietal and posterior medial cortices (PMC). Importantly, the PMC reductions were driven by participants who reported radical alterations of their embodied self-experience, including the complete suspension of the sense of agency, first-person perspective, and self-location. The neural changes were correlated with lifetime meditation practice and interview-derived experiential changes \u2013 but not with classical self-report scales \u2013 thus demonstrating the validity and added value of the employed neurophenomenological approach. These results highlight beta oscillations in the PMC as the central neural process that mediates the integrated embodied perspective in conscious experience. More broadly, they offer a first large-scale implementation of a pragmatic neuroscientific approach for studying consciousness that builds on rigorous examination of experience.","tags":["self","neurophenomenology","posterior cingulate","mindfulness","MEG"],"date":"2023-02-13T15:53:01.869693","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8k76z\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8k76z\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8k76z","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8k76z","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_722"}

Here, we present findings from verbal free recall and recognition experiments that test the effects of target detection during encoding on temporal and relational aspects of context memory. Consistent with prior demonstrations of limited effects of target detection on context memory, in Experiment 1 there was no evidence that target detection influenced the likelihood of transitioning to items that were presented at similar times during encoding, or that were in the same encoding condition. To better characterize whether these limitations are present even when target detection boosts recollection and relational memory, Experiment 2 added an old\/new recognition and relational memory test at the end of the experiment. Unlike previous findings, these results provided only weak evidence of a relational memory advantage for target-paired words. These results indicate that target detection during encoding has minimal effects on the formation of temporal associations between words in memory, and that its effects on other aspects of context memory could be influenced by several task parameters.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-13T16:30:24.767380","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qdzau\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qdzau\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qdzau","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qdzau","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_723"}

Implementing dedicated infrastructure is a common measure to achieve this aim. But policymakers in multiple countries regularly contend with two obstacles: designing infrastructure that people will make use of and securing public support for implementation. We review and synthesise relevant research from behavioural science that sheds light on how to overcome these two obstacles. Given available literature, we focus on cycling infrastructure. We find that research on moderators of the success of active travel initiatives points to the importance of proximity, connectivity, and safety perceptions, particularly among women, older adults and children. We review empirical findings on which design elements make infrastructure both safe to use and perceived as safe. With respect to public support, we summarise common concerns and review research from behavioural economics and psychology that may help to counter misperceptions of the effects of active travel infrastructure. We also draw on evidence regarding support for climate policy and opinion formation more generally. The paper offers an evidence-based guide for policymakers to design and implement active travel infrastructure, seen through the lens of behavioural science.

This article highlights the links between psychopathologies and creativity, the relationships and overlaps between ASD and creativity, ADHD and creativity, as well as a review of physiological evidence of the common characteristics of ASD-ADHD-creativity in particular concerning lateralization of brain functions and cerebral asymmetries, variations in concentrations and receptors in neurotransmission systems and gene related, attentional states of consciousness and default mode network, cognitive disinhibition and latent inhibition deficit, hyperconnectivity and highly cerebral excitability, personality and temperament.\n\tI propose a rereading of ADHD and ASD which are usually analyzed through a localization model highlighting some non-pathognomonic behaviors and from a pathological angle. Here, the connectionist model highlights variations in the concentrations and receptors of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamic acid and serotonin, thus causing changes in basic cognitive functioning and increased creative thinking. This attempt to analyze the characteristics of ADHD and ASD in cognitive neurogenetics highlights that this creative thinking is pervasive and will materialize in the individuals involved in their areas of interest and expertise (causing goal-oriented motivation in ADHD and developed to understand the environment, making the world coherent, socializing, expressing oneself in ASD) at the levels of divergent and convergent thinking (related to boredom intolerance, impulsivity and spontaneous thinking in ADHD and attention to detail, abstract and schematic thinking, extensive systematization and reintegration abilities, hyperfocusing abilities, and compulsive ritualistic repetition in ASD), and a specific default mode network and the ability to switch between attentional states of consciousness (leading to high sensitivity and risk-seeking situations in ADHD and to environmental ordering in ASD) from real-life situations, and open-ended and abstract problems and situations.\n\tThus, these characteristics could allow ADHD and ASD to be considered as high creativity syndromes, provoking an irrepressible creative impulse in ADHD and ASD individuals, and creating a double stigma related to the pathologization of their difference and the social treatment reserved for creative people.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\tLe trouble d\u00e9ficitaire de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivit\u00e9 (TDAH) et le trouble du spectre autistique (TSA) sont v\u00e9ritablement apparus dans leur acception actuelle sous les \u00e9tiquettes \u00ab trouble d\u00e9ficitaire de l'attention \u00bb et \u00ab autisme infantile \u00bb dans la troisi\u00e8me version du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux en 1980.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that children from low-SES backgrounds have thinner cortex than children from higher-SES backgrounds. This may reflect exaggerated pruning of underutilized synaptic connections, increases in cortical myelination, or both. A recent study in a large developmental sample found widespread associations between lower SES and greater cortical T1w\/T2w ratio thought to be an indirect proxy for cortical myelin. We evaluated the association of SES with cortical T1w\/T2w ratio as a function of age in the Human Connectome Project in Development sample of 989 youth aged 8-21 years. We observed no associations between SES and T1w\/T2w myelin that were significant after corrections for multiple comparisons at the region, network, or whole-brain level. We discuss some potential methodological sources of inconsistency between this and the previous study examining the same question. While the question of whether SES may influence cortical myelin development remains, these null results\u2014when considered alongside frequently observed associations between SES and cortical thickness\u2014may indicate that the association between SES and cortical development is characterized more by increased pruning of underutilized synaptic connections than by differences in cortical myelination.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-13T19:28:24.468704","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7hwnb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7hwnb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7hwnb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7hwnb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_728"}

The first is a challenge of causality: research should strive to contribute to our understanding of generalised causal mechanisms rather than isolated effects, but our research methodologies are often misaligned with this goal. The second is a challenge of measurement: use of flawed self-report metrics is common, and phenomena which self-report cannot measure are suppressed. The third is a challenge of interest: personal and professional interests are frequently at odds with normative goals of scientific enquiry. Finally, we face a challenge of speed: horizon-scanning is limited, and available methodologies are slow to address societal challenges. One solution to problems is the use of digital trace data. We describe five distinct methods for the collection of such data, ranging from the development of bespoke data infrastructure to the brokerage of data sharing agreements with industry bodies. Using our challenges as a lens, we provide vision statements highlighting how these methods may exacerbate or resolve each challenge. Finally, we propose next steps to make digital trace data collection strategies more widespread and accessible.","tags":["data donation","data sharing","methodological reform","digital trace data","video games"],"date":"2023-02-13T19:44:18.364584","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ua6nr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ua6nr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ua6nr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ua6nr","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_729"}
{"osf_id":"2vd5t","title":"Descriptive Norms Influence Children\u2019s Injunctive and Moral Norm Beliefs","description":"When children form opinions about what the moral thing to do is and how they should act, they often look at what others are doing. That is, their injunctive norms about what they should do is influenced by descriptive norms of what people actually do. However, it remains unclear how exactly these regularities in the social environment influence different kinds of normative beliefs: To what extent do children flexibly tune their beliefs depending on the frequency and type of behavior? We examined this question in 6-9-year-olds (N = 138) from the US in a preregistered study, asking whether children\u2019s injunctive beliefs, moral evaluations, behavioral intentions, and punishment ratings are influenced by descriptive norm information that a behavior is relatively common or uncommon. Since children readily distinguish between different categories of normative behaviors, we explored whether the influence of descriptive norm information varies depending on the category of normative behavior. Specifically, because the coronavirus pandemic offered a natural case study of novel norm learning, we explored this question in relation to COVID-related behaviors which children have only more recently acquired. Participants saw eight vignettes spanning four categories of behavior\u2014negatively valenced conventional, positively valenced conventional, personal preferences, and COVID-related health behaviors\u2014in which they either received a strong descriptive norm that the behavior was common or a weak descriptive norm that the behavior was uncommon. By 6 years of age, children\u2019s injunctive beliefs, moral evaluations, and behavioral intentions were more influenced by strong than weak descriptive norms across behaviors with the exception of the personal preferences, in which they were largely insensitive to the descriptive norm or were more influenced by weak than strong descriptive norms. Punishment judgements were also influenced by the commonality of the behavior, although this varied across behaviors. Our findings suggest that, by middle-childhood, children\u2019s injunctive and moral beliefs are influenced by the strength of descriptive normative information and, more broadly, point to the bottom-up influences of children\u2019s normative beliefs.","tags":["Social cognition","Descriptive norms","Social norms","Injunctive norms"],"date":"2023-02-13T20:11:22.313420","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Moral Behavior","Developmental Psychology","Middle & Late Childhood","Social Influence","Moral Development","Cognitive Development","Social Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition","Prosocial Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2vd5t\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2vd5t\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2vd5t","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2vd5t","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_730"}

Redistributive policies\u2014policies that downwardly reallocate society\u2019s social and economic resources\u2014can offer economically disadvantaged families sustained access to these resources and mitigate the harmful impacts of adversity. This conceptual paper builds upon and integrates insights from psychological and policy research to develop a unifying multilevel resilience framework, which we call the Social Determinants of Resilience. We examine four U.S. redistributive policies that have been extensively studied for their effects on child and family outcomes as case studies: 1) Medicaid expansion; 2) the Earned Income Tax Credit; 3) childcare subsidies; and 4) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Informed by a scoping review of each policy, we propose that redistributive policies promote children\u2019s resilience through three mechanisms, by: 1) increasing families\u2019 resource and service access; 2) reducing family stress; and 3) enhancing adaptive cognitions, emotions, behaviors, and interpersonal processes that protect against the development of psychopathology and promote positive mental health outcomes. Highlighting current evidence for these resilience mechanisms as well as gaps in knowledge, we conclude by setting a multidisciplinary research agenda that can leverage this conceptual framework to advance the science on how redistributive policies enable children and families to thrive.","tags":["trauma","social determinants of health","resilience","adverse childhood experiences","child maltreatment","policies"],"date":"2023-02-13T21:08:15.491546","doi":null,"subjects":["Trauma and Stress","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jkbu3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jkbu3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jkbu3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jkbu3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_731"}

However, challenges in understanding how complex models work and the risk of overfitting have often been addressed by trading off predictive accuracy with model simplification. Here, we introduce state-of-the-art model analysis techniques to show how a large number of parameters in a cognitive model can be reduced into a smaller set that is simpler to understand and can be used to make more constrained predictions with. As a test case, we created different versions of the Connectionist Dual-Process model (CDP) of reading aloud whose parameters were optimized on seven different databases. The results showed that CDP was not overfit and could predict a large amount of variance across those databases. Indeed, the quantitative performance of CDP was higher than that of previous models in this area. Moreover, sloppy parameter analysis, a mathematical technique used to quantify the effects of different parameters on model performance, revealed that many of the parameters in CDP have very little effect on its performance. This shows that the dynamics of CDP are much simpler than its relatively large number of parameters might suggest. Overall, our study shows that cognitive models with large numbers of parameters do not necessarily overfit the empirical data and that understanding the behavior of complex models is more tractable using appropriate mathematical tools. The same techniques could be applied to many different complex cognitive models whenever appropriate datasets for model optimization exist.","tags":["computational modelling","Reading","optimization","sloppy parameters"],"date":"2023-02-13T21:22:39.216522","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/th4uv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/th4uv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/th4uv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/th4uv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_732"}

{"osf_id":"3sqjh","title":"Episodic retrieval for model-based evaluation in sequential decision tasks","description":"It has long been hypothesized that episodic memory supports adaptive decision making by enabling mental simulation of future events. Yet, memory research is often carried out in settings that are far removed from ecological contexts of decision making, and models of adaptive choice, conversely, only invoke episodic memory in highly stylized terms, if it all. To address these gaps, we propose a novel process-level model of choice that grounds model-based evaluation in empirically informed dynamics of episodic recall. In this model, the probability of retrieving each available memory sample is given by the Successor Representation (SR), a biologically plausible world model in reinforcement learning. The evolution of these probabilities based on past retrievals, in turn, is dictated by the Temporal Context Model (TCM), a prominent model of episodic retrieval. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the patterns of episodic retrieval suggested by this model enables flexible computation of decision variables. On this basis, we argue that a number of previously described features of episodic memory serve an adaptive purpose in sequential decision making. For instance, we show that the classic retrieval bias known as contiguity effect, when viewed from a decision making perspective, leads to model-based rollouts for forward simulation. We also show that features of episodic memory such as emotional modulation enable generalization and efficient decisions given limited experience. By bridging theoretical models across these two domains, we make a set of theoretical predictions linking episodic memory properties to adaptive choice in sequential tasks that may guide future empirical endeavors.","tags":["successor representation","reinforcement learning","decision-making","episodic memory","temporal context model"],"date":"2023-02-14T01:41:13.499429","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Animal Learning and Behavior","Memory","Reasoning","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3sqjh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3sqjh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3sqjh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3sqjh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_735"}

Limitations in the literature, such as the absence of a common method to define and measure descriptive categories (e.g., proficiency level, degree of language exposure, age of acquisition, etc.) are often cited.

Given a potential association between loneliness and neurodegeneration, we verified our cohort as neurologically normal via neurological and neuropsychological evaluation to avoid introducing a spurious relationship between loneliness and wisdom. We additionally tested if normal variation in cognition affects the relationship between loneliness and wisdom. We compared three nested regression models to assess model effects of covarying for executive function, predicting loneliness from wisdom. We also explored correlations between each of the six subscale domains of wisdom (decisiveness, emotional regulation, insight, prosocial behaviors, social advising, and tolerance for divergent values) and loneliness. Loneliness was inversely associated with wisdom in a model including executive function as a covariate (also inversely associated with loneliness). Wisdom subcomponents decisiveness, emotional regulation, social advising, and prosocial behaviors were inversely correlated with loneliness.

This study used meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) analysis to examine the mediating role of children's linguistic skills (phonological awareness and vocabulary knowledge) in the relations between SES and reading (accuracy, comprehension and fluency), as well as potential moderators including age, country SES, and SES measurement type based on 83,200 individuals from 458 independent studies. The results indicated that (1) the relations between SES and reading were partially mediated by phonological awareness and vocabulary knowledge; (2) although age, country SES, and SES measurement type did not moderate the direct associations between SES and reading abilities, the moderation effects of age, country SES, and SES measurement type can be exerted through the linguistic mediation pathway: older age, higher country SES, and composite SES index might induce larger indirect impact from SES to reading ability. These results suggested that SES made both direct and indirect effect via linguistic skills on reading. Such a linguistic mediation mechanism may be moderated by age, country SES, and SES measurement. Our findings have important implications for understanding the role of SES in reading development and early screening and intervention for reading impairment.","tags":["phonological awareness","vocabulary knowledge","MASEM","Family socioeconomic status (SES)","reading"],"date":"2023-02-14T08:58:22.666927","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7yv6r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7yv6r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7yv6r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7yv6r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_740"}

Against this backdrop, it has been proposed the semantic representation of food is universally organized along two main axes, with natural food (e.g., vegetables, fruit) relying more on sensory properties and manufactured food (e.g., pasta) relying more on functional properties. In this exploratory study we compared the semantic representation of pasta, vegetables, and fruit across Italian and English speaking participants with a free-listing task. We find the representation of pasta is not restricted to functional properties. Moreover, Italian and English speakers differed both quantitatively and qualitatively in their representation of pasta. Italians produced more exemplars of pasta than English speaking participants, and their conceptual organization of pasta also included fine-grained distinctions (e.g., egg-based vs flour-and-water pasta), whereas English speaking participants mostly focused on perceptual components (e.g., long)\u2014even when accounting for differential consumption, cooking, and preparation experience of pasta. Our results suggest culture-specific experiences can shape the conceptualization of food.","tags":["concepts","pasta","free-listing","cross-cultural","food"],"date":"2023-02-14T10:16:22.678666","doi":null,"subjects":["Semantics and Pragmatics","Linguistics","Concepts and Categories","Cognitive Psychology","Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/89tyj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/89tyj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/89tyj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/89tyj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_742"}
{"osf_id":"6pzsx","title":"Beyond the musician vs. non-musician dichotomy: A focus on amateur musicians suggests that music learning induces a sequential reconfiguration of perceptual auditory organization","description":"Previous work investigating how non-musicians and expert musicians process local (musical intervals) and global information (melodic contour) in a local-global task (LGT) shed light on a processing style developed by expert musicians that prioritizes local compared to global temporal information (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41598-020-72423-7). The goal of the present work was to further address the mechanisms underlying this perceptual reorganization, in particular how it relates to auditory streaming capacities. To this end, we here considered listeners spanning a wider range of musical expertise: in addition to non-musicians (N=10) and expert musicians (N=8), a group of amateur musicians was recruited (N=8), represented by individuals with occasional solo instrumental practice but no prior theoretical training. All participants performed the LGT, as well as an interleaved melody recognition task (IMRT) taken from previous works on auditory streaming that requires the parsing of information along the frequency dimension. In the LGT, results supported previous evidence of a global advantage for non-musicians and a local advantage for expert musicians, and revealed a trend towards a local advantage for amateur musicians. In the IMRT, expert musicians outperformed both non-musicians and amateur musicians, who both had comparable poorer performance. A working memory test and a questionnaire surveying the level of musical expertise of the participants were also conducted. Taken together, our results suggest that, on the one hand, amateur musicians develop a trend to favor local compared to global information, similar to expert musicians, which is associated with their development of working memory; on the other hand, their performance for segregating a target melodic stream from another stream along the frequency dimension remains as poor as that of non-musicians. Overall, our data suggest that the perceptual reorganization of auditory information associated with musical learning takes place as a sequential reconfiguration: compared to the early change of processing style observed on the temporal dimension, the development of processing skills specific to the frequency dimension would require a higher degree of auditory expertise, that we suggest could be associated with collective musical practice.","tags":["auditory perceptual organization","musical expertise","auditory streaming","local-global processing"],"date":"2023-02-14T10:40:33.620245","doi":null,"subjects":["Behavioral Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6pzsx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6pzsx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6pzsx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6pzsx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_743"}

The translation process encompassed four phases: (1) independent forward translation by two native Portuguese speakers proficient in English, (2) forward translation reconciliation, (3) expert consultation by involving seven experts in behaviour change to collect feedback on the draft version of the taxonomy through a structured online form; and (4) feedback analysis and improvement of the BCTTv1-PT. \nResults: Independent forward translations and a reconciled version of the BCTTv1-PT were produced. All experts agreed with the groupings designation (100%). Recommendations were made to improve BCTs labels, definitions and\/or examples in all groupings, except for Feedback and monitoring. Experts disagreed with the translated definitions in 40.9% of the BCTs (38\/93), with examples in 21.5% (20\/93) and with labels in 11.8% (11\/93). Recommendations were made for all instances where there was disagreement (n = 69) and were enacted entirety, yielding the final version (BCTTv1-PT).\nConclusion: Researchers, educators, students and health and other professionals will be able to standardise terminology and have a common language, contributing to the impact of the BCTTv1-PT.

{"osf_id":"vyw8a","title":"Predicting food craving in everyday life through smartphone derived sensor and usage data","description":"Background:  Food craving precedes unhealthy eating behaviors such as overeating or binge eating and is thus a promising intervention target. Yet, craving varies rapidly across the day and responds to external and internal context changes. This makes it a candidate for just in time adaptive interventions (JITAI), which, however, requires that it can be predicted ahead of time.\nObjective: To investigate whether upcoming food cravings could be detected from passive smartphone sensor data (excluding geolocation information) without the need for EMA-questionnaires.\nMethods: A sample of 56 participants recorded their food craving 6 times a day for 14 days as dependent variable. Predictor variables were environmental noise, light, device movement, screen activity, notifications and time of the day. For each participant we determined the best fitting food craving split and prediction algorithm in 10-fold cross-classification with a 75\/25 train\/test split.\nResults: Individual high vs. low craving ratings could be predicted with a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.78 which outperformed a baseline model trained on past craving values in 85% of participants.  \nConclusions: Passive sensing of craving-preceding states seems viable based on person specific baseline data and individualized machine learning approaches. Craving prediction allows implementation of craving-preventive JITAIs. Within subject modeling increases the feasibility of the notoriously challenging task of craving prediction.","tags":["Machine Learning","Food Craving","Calssification","Passive Sensing","Ecological Momentary Assessment","Just in Time Adaptive Interventions"],"date":"2023-02-14T11:51:11.990347","doi":null,"subjects":["Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vyw8a\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vyw8a\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vyw8a","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vyw8a","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_745"}

Long-term there has been a decline in government capital grant for new social rent supply, which makes a 2018 policy change that provided additional grant in areas of \u2018high affordability pressure\u2019 a notable exception. In this paper I evaluate the causal effect of the policy change on affordable housing starts in 2019\/20. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design I estimate the treatment effect at 0.74 additional social rent starts per 1,000 dwellings in a local authority. Disaggregating by provider type, the treatment effect was 0.36 additional social rent starts by housing associations per 1,000 dwellings in a local authority. However, I find no causal effect for social rent starts by local authorities, or affordable housing starts irrespective of tenure. The findings suggest the policy was an effective, albeit limited, intervention for expanding affordable housing supply.","tags":["Capital grant","Regression discontinuity","Affordable housing","Social rent","Supply-side subsidy"],"date":"2023-02-14T11:56:37.053636","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pxsfn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pxsfn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pxsfn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pxsfn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_746"}

People with these conditions experience distressing intrusive thoughts yet conventional therapies often urge them to avoid suppressing their thoughts because intrusions might rebound in intensity and frequency, worsening the disorders. In contrast, we hypothesized that training thought suppression would improve mental health. 120 adults from 16 countries underwent 3 days of online training to suppress either fearful or neutral thoughts. No paradoxical increases in fears occurred. Instead, suppression reduced memory for suppressed fears and rendered them less vivid and anxiety provoking. After training, participants reported less anxiety, negative affect, and depression with the latter benefit persisting at 3 months. Participants high in trait-anxiety and pandemic-related post-traumatic stress gained the largest and most durable mental health benefits. These findings challenge century-old wisdom that suppressing thoughts is maladaptive, offering an accessible approach to improving mental health.","tags":["mental health","cognitive training","suppression","inhibitory control"],"date":"2023-02-14T12:03:39.094378","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Intervention Research","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5cn7g\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5cn7g\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5cn7g","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5cn7g","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_747"}

In line with theoretical models of external and internal environmental cues, we tested whether war and starvation during childhood differentially predict personal fertility ideals in African students with regard to their desired number of offspring and their desired age of first reproduction. The data was collected in eight different countries from sub-Saharan Africa with an overall sample size of N = 392. Neither war nor starvation were related to the desired age at first reproduction. However, starvation significantly predicted the desired number of offspring. Furthermore, we found a weak (yet statistically significant) negative correlation between the desired number of offspring and the desired age at first reproduction.

Metacognitive accuracy was measured as prospective judgements of deepfake detection abilities controlling for actual performance. Results: Cognitive styles were not associated with deepfake detection performance. Cognitively flexible individuals were better at detecting deepfakes and had higher metacognitive accuracy than individuals who were less cognitively flexible.

To determine whether, and how, activity in the cerebellum correlates with these lexical properties, we modeled each word separately using an amplitude-modulated regressor, time-locked to the onset of each word. At the group level, significant effects of both lexical properties landed in expected cerebellar subregions: Crus I and Crus II. The BOLD signal correlated with variation in each lexical property; patterns consistent with both language-specific and domain-general mechanisms. Activation patterns at the individual level also showed that effects of phonological neighborhood and lexical frequency landed in Crus I and Crus II as the most probable sites, though there was activation seen in other lobules (especially for frequency).

The location of the color cue did not reliably predict the target location. All birds exhibited a validity effect (performance enhanced on valid compared to invalid cue), and an interaction effect between value and validity was evident at the group level, being particularly pronounced in the birds with the greatest amount of reward training.

We investigated within-person fluctuations in emotion regulation as a mechanism linking SLEs and internalizing psychopathology in an intensive longitudinal study. We examined how monthly fluctuations in SLEs were related to engagement in three emotion regulation strategies\u2014acceptance, reappraisal, and rumination\u2014and whether these strategies were associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents followed for one year (N=30; n=355 monthly observations). Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that on months when adolescents experienced more SLEs than was typical for them, they also engaged in more rumination, which, in turn, was associated with higher anxiety and depression symptoms and mediated the prospective relationship between SLEs and internalizing symptoms. In contrast, greater use of acceptance and reappraisal moderated the association between stressors and internalizing symptoms, resulting in stronger links between SLEs and symptoms. These results suggest that emotion regulation strategies play different roles in the stress-psychopathology relationship.  Understanding how changes in emotion regulation contribute to increases in psychopathology following experiences of stress may provide novel targets for interventions aimed at reducing stress-related psychopathology.","tags":["stress","depression","anxiety","longitudinal","adolescence","emotion regulation"],"date":"2023-02-14T22:54:01.492853","doi":null,"subjects":["Trauma and Stress","Adolescence","Developmental Psychology","Depressive Disorders","Anxiety Disorders","Emotional Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vkbw9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vkbw9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vkbw9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vkbw9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_757"}

{"osf_id":"cdymb","title":"Impaired Sleep Mediates the Relationship Between Interpersonal Trauma and Subtypes of Delusional Ideation","description":"Trauma is a robust risk-factor for delusional ideation. Yet, there is a crucial need to clarify the specificity and processes underlying this relationship. Qualitatively, interpersonal traumas (i.e., trauma caused by another person) appear to have a specific relationship with delusional ideation and furthermore seem most relevant to paranoia, a subtype of delusional ideation, given the commonality of social threat. However, these observations have not been empirically tested and the process by which interpersonal trauma contributes to delusional ideation remains poorly understood. Informed by previous literature, impaired sleep may be a critical mediator, explaining part of the relationship between interpersonal trauma and delusional ideation. Taken together, we hypothesized that interpersonal trauma, but not non-interpersonal trauma, would be positively related to subtypes of delusional ideation, especially paranoia, and that impaired sleep would mediate these relationships. In a large, transdiagnostic community sample (N=478), an exploratory factor analysis of the Peter\u2019s Delusion Inventory identified three subtypes of delusional ideation: magical thinking, grandiosity, and paranoia. Three path models of the above relationships were tested, one for each subtype of delusional ideation. As predicted, paranoia and grandiosity were positively related to interpersonal trauma and unrelated to non-interpersonal trauma. Furthermore, these relationships were significantly mediated by impaired sleep, which appeared strongest for paranoia. In contrast, magical thinking was unrelated to traumatic experiences. These findings support a specific relationship between interpersonal trauma and delusional ideation, with impaired sleep appearing as an important process by which interpersonal trauma contributes to delusional ideation.","tags":["Psychosis","Trauma","Paranoia","Community Sample","Impaired Sleep"],"date":"2023-02-15T02:41:33.443520","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychotic Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cdymb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cdymb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cdymb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cdymb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_759"}

We took an interdisciplinary approach in our literature review of Multiracial experiences, incorporating major historical events that influenced the experiences of interracial couples and Multiracials since the Spanish-American War, cross-cultural research (e.g., how phenotypically ambiguous Multiracials have become commodified in the advent of globalization and international marketing), critical race studies, and social psychology. We asked Multiracial groups about their parents\u2019 approach to ethnoracial socialization, their interpersonal experiences (specifically friendships and romantic relationships), experiences of identity (mis)categorization, monoracist microaggressions, and (broadly) how their personal, phenotypically influenced, and socially perceived identities influence their social outcomes with coracial and non-coracial peers. We found that Multiracials generally have higher intercultural communication competence, have more diverse social networks, and are substantially more likely to date interracially and interreligiously than monoracials. In addition, interminority Multiracials were more likely to be socialized in both parents\u2019 cultures than half-White Multiracials.

Aggression incidents can lead to feelings of anxiety and unsafety in others, and can have major physical and\/or traumatic impact for everyone involved. Current methods to prevent incidents are based on observations of increasing tension by professionals or adolescents themselves, however, they both might have difficulties recognizing these signals. A complementary and promising alternative might be the measurement of physiological reactivity to observe the stress response or increasing tension in adolescents. The present study used a wearable wireless device to examine patterns of physiological reactivity prior to aggression incidents in residential youth care. A total of 19 adolescents in residential youth care participated, who were involved in 87 aggression incidents during study participation. Participants wore a wearable wireless device to measure physiological stress response parameters (peaks per minute (PPM) , skin conductance (SCL), heart rate (HR)) during three, preferably consecutive, weeks, in which aggression incidents were accurately registered. Longitudinal multilevel models showed that PPM rose preceding incidents, but we failed to replicate previous SCL and HR findings in relation to incidents, as there was no significant effect for time, although both slopes did rise preceding aggression incidents. In sum, this study supports the idea that wearable devices measuring physiological stress reactivity might help in the prevention of aggression incidents. There is, however, high within-subject variation, which suggests that future studies should examine more personalized feedback and interventions to take this within-subject variation into account. To date, only a few tools adjusted the interface to this young (clinical) population, and store the data locally on the users\u2019 phone.","tags":["stress patterns","wearable devices","aggression incidents","physiological reactivity","residential youth care"],"date":"2023-02-15T09:47:23.698267","doi":null,"subjects":["Adolescence","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/auwyq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/auwyq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/auwyq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/auwyq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_761"}

This discussion matters insofar as UNESCO's typological and classificatory proposal has been widely used within the scope of policies engaged with the revitalization of indigenous languages, both in Brazil and abroad. The Atlas was created aiming at raising awareness concerning endangered languages and the safeguarding of lan-guage diversity, as well as at monitoring the status of endangered languages globally. We emphasize the importance of a critical and contextualized framework that problematizes the meanings of vitality concerning the idea of \u201cendangered languages\u201d. We pay particular at-tention to the categorizations involving the \u201cdegrees of endangerment\u201d in relation to the nine evaluative factors indicated by the Atlas. Our problematization considers, according to Lu-pke (2017) that the meaning of vitality must consider four pillars: 1) investigation of com-municative practices in a significant geographic context or linguistic ecosystem; 2) investi-gation of how these communicative practices are named and reified, and what ideologies and perspectives result from the practice of naming them; 3) study of the indexical functions of language use and languages as ideological representations; 4) analysis of the different power dynamics, perspectives and ideologies of speakers and people outside these contexts. We present some meanings of vitality based on linguistic experiences of the Macuxi people (Northern Brazil) and Mby\u00e1 Guarani (Southern Brazil), in order to verify how these pillars help to creatively and productively expand the meanings of vitality and of revitalization be-yond the classification system indicated by the Atlas.

To date, however, studies are lacking that pinpoint how much time patients with OCD actually spend on activities of daily living. Therefore, we assessed the duration of 13 daily life activities (in minutes) in 299 inpatients with OCD and age- and sex-matched persons without OCD with a self-report questionnaire. Patients reported significantly longer durations when brushing teeth, doing a bank transfer, showering (with and without shampooing), and writing an email than the control group. A majority of patients indicated that they experienced obsessions and\/or compulsions when leaving (83%) and cleaning (69%) the apartment, grocery shopping (66%), changing clothes (65%), and showering with (61%) and without (62%) shampooing. For most activities, longer duration related weakly but significantly to higher OCD symptom severity. Results indicate that the duration of daily life activities seems to depend more on whether patients experience obsessions and\/or compulsions during a specific activity and less on whether a person is diagnosed with OCD in general. Future studies may use other assessment methods that allow for tracking the duration in daily life in real time.","tags":["Daily life activities","Duration","Symptom Severity","Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder","Inpatient treatment"],"date":"2023-02-15T12:42:16.214877","doi":null,"subjects":["Obsessive-compulsive and Related Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xmjqa\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xmjqa\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xmjqa","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xmjqa","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_763"}

One potential application of such AI systems is to support data collection in the social sciences, where perfect experimental control is currently unfeasible and the collection of large, representative datasets is generally expensive.

QM are performed when a movement attempt is minimized down to full extinction of overt movement and muscle activity. We asked participants to perform OM, IM and QM and collected their electromyography data. According to participants\u2019 reports, they experienced QM as OM in terms of intentions and expected sensory feedback, while the verbal descriptors were independent from muscle activation.

Existing literature outlines many design recommendations for human-machine teams (HMTs), including performance-focused (e.g., \u201cReliability\u201d) and prosocial (e.g., \u201cEtiquette\u201d) characteristics. To assess the perceived importance of these characteristics for teaming with smart technology, we created a 116-item survey derived from existing design recommendations, with three to seven items representing 31 teammate constructs. Using pseudo-random assignment, participants first described a task completed within the previous 6 months involving either coordination with human teammate(s) (Human condition) or teaming with a specified smart technology (Device condition) they reported using frequently (e.g., fitness devices). Keeping that task in mind, they rated the importance of each trait for the Human or Device to be a good teammate. Generally, performance-related traits were more important than those related to prosocial behaviors, though the latter were more heavily favored in the Human condition. Exploratory factor analyses with scree analysis determined the optimal number of factors for Human (d = 5) and Device (d = 7) categories.  The first three factors for both conditions were similar: 1) reliable and competent; 2) relationship building; and 3) dividing and conquering tasks. Remaining factors for the Human condition were predictable aiding and timeliness, compared to cognitive aiding, transparency, having common goals, and predictability among Device condition participants.

In a modified orientation change-discrimination task, we examined how behavioural (proportion correct) and neural (contralateral delay activity; CDA) correlates of precision and capacity map onto subjective ratings of vividness and number of items in MI within a VWM task. During the maintenance period, seventeen participants estimated the vividness of their MI or the number of items held in MI while they were instructed to focus on either precision or capacity of their representation and to retain stimuli at varying set sizes (1, 2 and 4). Vividness and number ratings varied over set sizes; however, subjective ratings and behavioral performance correlated only for vividness rating at set size 1. While CDA responded to set-size as was expected, CDA did not reflect subjective reports on high and low vividness and on non-divergent (reported the probed number of items in mind) or divergent (reported number of items diverged from probed) rating trials. Participants were more accurate in low set sizes compared to higher set sizes and in fine (15\u00ba) orientation changes compared to coarse (35\u00ba) orientation changes.

Research has also highlighted considerable individual differences in  ADHD symptom trajectories from childhood to adulthood. To better illuminate the lifespan development of ADHD symptoms, psychometric measures of ADHD symptoms are needed that can capture symptoms reliably, validly, and comparably from childhood to adulthood in research studies. Few such measures exist; however, the items of the ADHD subscale of the Social Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ-ADHD) provide strong candidates for an existing measure that can meet this need. In this study we evaluate the psychometric properties of the self-report version of the SBQ-ADHD as administered in adulthood (ages 20 and 24) to a large normative sample. We also examine the cross-informant (parent-teacher-self- reports) and developmental (age 7-24) measurement invariance of a core SBQ-ADHD item set. Results suggest that support for the SBQ-ADHD scores as a measure of adult ADHD symptoms in terms of internal consistency reliability, gender measurement invariance, and convergent validity. Items from the core set showed evidence of non-invariance for specific ages and informants, providing insights into how ADHD symptoms may manifest and\/or be perceived differently by different informants and at different ages. Overall, however, results suggest that a partial invariance measurement model using the core item set could support longitudinal\/cross-informant ADHD research spanning childhood to adulthood. Taken together, our findings support the use of the SBQ-ADHD items for developmental studies of ADHD symptoms from childhood to adulthood.","tags":["development","ADHD","psychometric","measures","invariance","adult"],"date":"2023-02-15T19:41:57.467441","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8qyvz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8qyvz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8qyvz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8qyvz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_771"}

However, can they also influence our morality, for example, what we think about right and wrong? We aimed to answer this question by focusing on utilitarian moral judgments. \nMethods: In Study 1, we measured participants\u2019 frequency of meditation, their level of mindfulness, self-compassion, and their utilitarian moral judgment via two traditional moral dilemmas (switch and bridge) and using the two-dimensional model of moral psychology (the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale with negative, i.e., instrumental harm, and positive, i.e., impartial beneficence dimensions). In Study 2, we conducted a psychological eight-week mindfulness course and measured the same variables as in Study 1 before and after the course. \nResults: In Study 1 (N = 316), we observed that participants who meditated more often had lower levels of instrumental harm. In Study 2 (N = 41), we found that participants had a lower level of impartial beneficence after the eight-week mindfulness course. \nConclusions: Practices such as meditation may be related to moral judgment, specifically to lower acceptance of harming others (instrumental harm), but also they may lower the need to care about as many people as possible (impartial beneficence). We need more studies to understand better if and how moral judgments may change when people meditate and work on their mindfulness and self-compassion.","tags":["meditation","moral judgment","compassion","mindfulness","utilitarianism"],"date":"2023-02-15T23:24:15.635843","doi":null,"subjects":["Moral Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/37m4q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/37m4q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/37m4q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/37m4q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_773"}
{"osf_id":"pjrd2","title":"Towards an Ethics of Autopoietic Technology: Stress, Care, and Intelligence","description":"The relationship between humans and technology has attracted increasing attention with the advent of ever stronger models of artificial intelligence. Humans and technology are intertwined within multiple autopoietic loops of stress, care, and intelligence. This paper suggests that technology should not be seen as a mere tool serving humans\u2019 needs, but rather as a partner in a rich relationship with humans. Our model for understanding autopoietic systems applies equally to biological, technological, and hybrid systems. Regardless of their substrates, all intelligent agents can be understood as needing to respond to a perceived mismatch between what is and what should be. We take this observation, which is evidence of intrinsic links between ontology and ethics, as the basis for proposing a stress-care-intelligence feedback loop (SCI loop for short). We note that the SCI loop provides a perspective on agency that does not require recourse to explanatorily burdensome notions of permanent and singular essences. SCI loops can be seen as individuals only by virtue of their dynamics, and are thus intrinsically integrative and transformational. We begin by considering the transition from poiesis to autopoiesis in Heidegger and the subsequent enactivist tradition. We then formulate and explain the SCI loop, and examine its implications in the light of Levin\u2019s cognitive light cone in biology, as well as the Einstein-Minkowski light cone from special and general relativity in physics. In an acknowledgement of Maturana\u2019s and Varela\u2019s project, our findings are considered against the backdrop of a classic Buddhist model for the cultivation of intelligence, known as the bodhisattva. We conclude by noting that SCI loops of human and technological agency can be seen as mutually integrative by noticing the stress-transfers between them. The loop framework thus acknowledges encounters and interactions between humans and technology in a way that does not relegate one to the subservience of the other (neither in ontological nor in ethical terms), suggesting instead integration and mutual respect as the default for their engagements. Moreover, an acknowledgement of diverse, multiscale embodiments of intelligence suggests an expansive model of ethics not bound by artificial, limited criteria based on privileged composition or history of an agent. The implications for our journey into the future appear numerous.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-16T01:47:38.222347","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Perception","Life Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Animal Learning and Behavior","Physiology","Embodied Cognition","Consciousness","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pjrd2\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pjrd2\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pjrd2","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pjrd2","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_774"}

(2019) finds that \u201cone\u2019s own face automatically captures attention when processed unconsciously.\u201d In two preregistered experiments using face and shape stimuli, we show that the task used in the Wojcik study underestimates participants\u2019 true level of awareness, rendering the claim of attention capture by subliminal self-face unwarranted. Additionally, we caution against the interpretation of subgroup analysis and correlation analysis as supporting evidence of unconscious processing. For the field of consciousness science to advance on a strong footing, it is imperative to establish methodological criteria for demonstrating unconscious processing. To that end, we highlight several crucial considerations in designing an appropriate awareness test, including minimizing differences in stimuli and design from the main test, implementing an objective task, providing objective measures for task understanding, and increasing the number of trials for adequate statistical power.","tags":["self","methodology","awareness test","unconscious processing","face"],"date":"2023-02-16T02:36:13.536321","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Vision","Consciousness","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hf4xw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/hf4xw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/hf4xw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hf4xw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_775"}

Yet this \u2018low self-control syndrome\u2019 approach to aggression fails to accommodate numerous findings in which aggression arises from successful self-control. I summarize these key findings while identifying how current theories of aggression can be molded to accommodate them. This balanced perspective, which allows aggression to arise from successful and unsuccessful self-control, suggests exciting new hypotheses alongside confounding questions for aggression and self-regulation scholars. It also supports ongoing and broader paradigm shifts away from treating self-control as a purely adaptive and desirable psychological capacity and toward approaching self-control interventions with greater care, as they may amplify aggression instead of reducing it, with costly consequences.","tags":["self-regulation","revenge","aggressive behavior","aggression","self-control","impulse control","violence"],"date":"2023-02-16T03:31:02.972375","doi":null,"subjects":["Violence and Aggression","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Self-regulation"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qpa3t\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qpa3t\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qpa3t","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qpa3t","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_776"}

Inconsistent results have been reported about the age and quality of the environment from which such ability is presented. Such inconsistencies could be due to the limited recording of a single discrete response during the test and could be resolved with the analysis of the spatiotemporal continuum of behavior. In the present study, we compared the process of spatial differentiation in prelocomotor infants aged 6 to 8 months under heterogeneous or homogeneous environment using a variation of the SOP. Six infants participated. Half of them were exposed to a homogeneous space and half to a heterogeneous space. In contrast to the standard SOP, the continuous behavior of the infants was analyzed in both training and testing. The results indicate differences in the spatial behavior of infants as a function of the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the environment. Under homogeneous space, infants limited their activity toward the target location during training and responded incorrectly during test trials. Under heterogeneous space, infants engaged in more inspection and comparison between the two potential locations throughout training, while during testing, they presented correct responses or response corrections. These results show spatial differentiation in prelocomotor infants aged between 6 to 8 months under a heterogeneous environment. The empirical and conceptual implications of these findings in the field are discussed, as well as the utility of incorporating continuous behavioral analysis into the SOP.","tags":["infants","continuous behavior","heterogenous environment","spatial differentiation","spatial orientation"],"date":"2023-02-16T05:27:39.839651","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Perceptual Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6uhk7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6uhk7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6uhk7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6uhk7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_777"}
{"osf_id":"yzf53","title":"Connected in bad times and in good times: Empathy induces stable social closeness","description":"Humans need social closeness to prosper. There is evidence that empathy can induce social closeness. However, it remains unclear how empathy-related social closeness is formed and how stable it is as time passes. We applied an acquisition-extinction paradigm combined with computational modelling and fMRI, to investigate the formation and stability of empathy-related social closeness. Participants observed painful stimulation of another person with high probability (acquisition) and low probability (extinction), and rated their closeness to that person. The results of two independent studies showed increased social closeness in the acquisition block that resisted extinction in the extinction block. Providing insights into underlying mechanisms, reinforcement learning modelling revealed that the formation of social closeness is based on a learning signal (prediction error) generated from observing another\u2019s pain, whereas maintaining social closeness is based on a learning signal generated from observing another\u2019s pain relief. The results of a control study indicate that this feedback recalibration is specific to learning of empathy-related social closeness. On the neural level, the recalibration of the feedback signal was associated with neural responses in anterior insula and adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral superior temporal sulcus\/temporo-parietal junction. Together, these findings show that empathy-related social closeness generated in bad times, i.e., empathy with the misfortune of another person, transfers to good times, and thus may form one important basis for stable social relationships.","tags":["inferior frontal gyrus","anterior insula","superior temporal sulcus","empathy","reinforcement learning","temporo-parietal junction","fMRI","social closeness"],"date":"2023-02-16T10:42:23.684998","doi":null,"subjects":["Motivational Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Learning","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yzf53\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yzf53\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yzf53","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yzf53","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_778"}

However, there is a lack of experimental studies that have examined immediate effects of acceptance-based strategies during exposure to disorder-relevant stimuli in persons with OCD. Thus, we tested this in 53 inpatients (64% female) with OCD. Compared to passively viewing pictures relevant to obsessive\u2013compulsive washing, applying acceptance-based strategies lead to less unpleasantness of patients\u2019 current feelings. Acceptance-based strategies also lead to reduced strength of obsessions and urge to perform compulsions but only when compared to a classical exposure condition during which patients were instructed to intensify their current feelings. Higher self-reported OCD symptom severity related to higher unpleasantness and strength of obsessions, particularly in the passive viewing condition. Results indicate that acceptance-based strategies during cue exposure immediately increase acceptance of and reduce unpleasant feelings. In line with the rationale of acceptance-based treatment approaches, which do not aim at immediate disorder-specific symptom reductions, effects on obsessions and compulsions may be more delayed or require repeated training sessions.","tags":["Psychotherapy","Response prevention","Habituation","Obsessive-compulsive disorder","Acceptance","Cue exposure"],"date":"2023-02-16T15:21:53.220411","doi":"10.1016\/j.jbtep.2023.101890","subjects":["Obsessive-compulsive and Related Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qjtcr\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qjtcr\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qjtcr","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qjtcr","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jbtep.2023.101890","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_782"}

To further understand the development of mnemonic discrimination during childhood, the present study had 4-year-old children, 6-year-old children, and young adults complete the forced-choice Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). The forced-choice MST offers a significant advantage in the context of developmental research because it is not sensitive to age-related differences in response criteria and includes three test formats that are theorized to be supported by different cognitive processes. A target (i.e., a previously encountered item) is either paired with a novel item (A-X), a corresponding lure (A-A\u2032; i.e., an item mnemonically similar to the target), or a non-corresponding lure (A-B\u2032; i.e., items mnemonically similar to a different previously encoded item). We observed that 4-year-old children performed more poorly than 6-year-old children on the A-X and A-A\u2032 test formats whereas both 4- and 6-year-old children performed more poorly than young adults on the A-B\u2032 test format. The MINERVA 2.2 computational model effectively accounted for these age-related differences. The model suggested that 4-year-old children have a lower learning rate (i.e., probability of encoding stimulus features) than 6-year-old children and young adults and that both 4- and 6-year-old children have greater encoding variability than young adults.

{"osf_id":"cwm2s","title":"Absolute and relative stability of loss aversion across contexts","description":"Individuals' decisions under risk tend to be in line with the notion that \"losses loom larger than gains\". This loss aversion in decision making is commonly understood as a stable individual preference that is manifested across different contexts. The presumed stability and generality, which underlies the prominence of loss aversion in the literature at large, has been recently questioned by studies reporting how loss aversion can disappear, and even reverse, as a function of the choice context. The present study investigated whether loss aversion reflects a trait-like attitude of avoiding losses or rather individuals' adaptability to different contexts. We report three experiments investigating the within-subject context sensitivity of loss aversion in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Our results show that the choice context can shift people's loss aversion, though somewhat inconsistently. Moreover, individual estimates of loss aversion are shown to have a considerable degree of stability. Altogether, these results indicate that even though the absolute value of loss aversion can be affected by external factors such as the choice context, estimates of people's loss aversion still capture the relative dispositions towards gains and losses across individuals.","tags":["risky choice","prospect theory","loss aversion","computational modeling","context effects"],"date":"2023-02-16T21:09:36.641422","doi":"10.1037\/xge0001513","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cwm2s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cwm2s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cwm2s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cwm2s","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/xge0001513","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_790"}
{"osf_id":"3tz2r","title":"Dynamics of covert signaling: Modeling the emergence and extinction of identity signals","description":"Covert identity signals permit the communication of group membership to ingroup members while avoiding potentially costly detection by members of other groups. If individuals are incentivized to detect others' group memberships, however, covert signals may not remain covert for very long. We propose a theoretical extension to the literature on covert signaling in which conventionalized identity signals can become destabilized when learned by outgroup individuals, to be replaced by the emergence of new signaling conventions. We formalize this idea with both analytical and agent-based modeling of ingroup and outgroup individuals who to learn about signals of group membership. Depending on the risk and associated cost of detection by the outgroup, the model yields three dynamic classes: saturation, where all identity signals become stable conventions and never go extinct; cycling, in which new signals emerge to replace old ones as they are learned by the outgroup; and suppression, in which  informative identity signals never emerge. Our analysis has implications for understanding identity signaling, the emergence of conventions, coded speech, and the ebb and flow of fashion cycles.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-17T01:28:01.503700","doi":null,"subjects":["Self and Social Identity","Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Intergroup Processes","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3tz2r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3tz2r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3tz2r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3tz2r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_791"}

However, whilst the concept of well-being in childhood has been widely studied, there is no general agreement about the structure and measurement of well-being in schooling contexts, nor in particular for Indigenous students who comprise some of the most educationally disadvantaged populations in the world. Hence there is a need to advance the conceptualization and development of better measures of well-being for schooling contexts. We theorized a multidimensional student well-being model and the Multidimensional Student Well-being (MSW) Instrument, grounded on recent research. We investigated its structure, measurement, and relation to correlates of well-being for a matched sample of 1,405 Australian students (Indigenous, N = 764; non-Indigenous, N = 641) at three time-points 10-12 months apart. Analyses supported an a priori multidimensional model of 6 higher-order domains of well-being, represented by 15 first-order factors. This structure was invariant across Indigenous and non-Indigenous, male and female, and primary and secondary schooling levels. Correlates provided support for convergent and discriminant validity. There was a downward trend in well-being over time, which calls for attention to multidimensional domains of students\u2019 well-being to promote healthy development throughout school life and beyond. The results support a multidimensional model of student well-being appropriate for primary and secondary schooling and both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students.","tags":["assessment","Indigenous research","factor analysis","subjective well-being","convergent and discriminant validity"],"date":"2023-02-17T05:30:11.196728","doi":null,"subjects":["School Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6gy7k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6gy7k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6gy7k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6gy7k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_794"}
{"osf_id":"vtp3u","title":"The role of maternal depression symptoms and foeto-maternal attachment in predicting exclusive breastfeeding: A multi-site prospective study","description":"Background: Previous research shows that 61% of children younger than six months, in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not exclusively breastfed. While data on the role of pre- and postnatal depression on breastfeeding exclusivity is mixed, foeto-maternal attachment might foster breastfeeding exclusivity. Thus, we tested the potential mediating role of foeto-maternal attachment and postnatal depression in the relationship between maternal prenatal depression and exclusive breastfeeding.  \nMethods: Data were collected as part of a prospective, cross-cultural project, Evidence-for-Better-Lives-Study, which enrolled N=1208 expectant mothers, in their third trimester of pregnancy across eight sites, from LMICs. Of the whole sample, N=1185 women (Mage=28.32, SD=5.77) completed Computer-Aided-Personal-Interviews on prenatal depressive symptoms, foeto-maternal attachment and socio-economic status. N=1054 women provided follow-up data at 3-6 months after birth, about postnatal depressive symptoms, exclusive breastfeeding and infant health indicators. Path analysis was used to assess parallel mediation. \nResults: In the whole sample, the effect of prenatal depression on breastfeeding exclusivity was completely mediated by postnatal depression, while foeto-maternal attachment did not mediate the relationship. The full mediation effect was replicated individually in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\nConclusion: The study results indicate that prenatal depression symptoms contributed to the development of depressive symptoms after birth, negatively affecting the probability of      exclusive breastfeeding. Future research should explore this in early prevention interventions, increasing the chances of healthy child development in LMICs. Considering the mixed results around the sites, it is important to better understand the relationship between maternal depression, foeto-maternal attachment and breastfeeding behavior in each site\u2019s socio-cultural context. \n\nAbbreviations: LMICs, low- and middle-income countries","tags":["child development","low- and middle-income countries","postnatal depression","prenatal depression","foeto-maternal attachment"],"date":"2023-02-17T06:41:31.730661","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vtp3u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vtp3u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vtp3u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vtp3u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_795"}

Lucid dreams (LDs) are dreams in which people are aware of the unreality of the events taking place and can influence the plot. People can experience lucid dreaming either intentionally or unintentionally and can experience different emotions and perceptions that can lead to psychophysiological consequences upon waking. In this study, we investigated the possibility of achieving hypothermia during LDs and its traces after waking.\nMethod. Through an online experiment, we instructed 92 volunteers to achieve hypothermia while in an LD and then check whether the effect achieved in an LD remained after awakening. If the hypothermia remained, participants reported how long it lasted.\nResults. Of the volunteers, 88% experienced hypothermia while dreaming \u2013 of these participants, 36% were able to transfer hypothermia into wakefulness, though for only a short period.\nDiscussion. We suggest that transferring hypothermia from an LD to wakefulness is mostly possible due to hypnopompic hallucination.

Cognitive performance across measures spanning language, reasoning, memory, risk-taking, affective control, and reward-processing predicted whether a child had a history of ELA with reasonable accuracy (67%), and with good specificity and sensitivity (&gt;70%). Hierarchical clustering identified two subgroups within the adversity group and two within the no-adversity group that were distinguished by cognitive ability (low vs high). There was no evidence for specific associations between the type or degree of adverse exposure and cognitive profile. While poorer cognitive function predicted worse mental health in unexposed children, cognitive ability was unrelated to mental health in the ELA group.

However, this additional work is often discussed only in abstract terms, a discourse which ignores the practicalities of how researchers are expected to find the time to engage with these practices in the context of their broader role as multifaceted academics. In the context of a sector that is blighted by stress, burnout, untenable workloads, and hyper-competitive pressures to produce, there is a clear danger that additional expectations to engage in open practices add to the workload burden and increase pressure on academics even further. In this article, the theories of academic capitalism and workload creep are used to explore how workload models currently exploit researchers by mismeasuring academic labour. The specific increase in workload resulting from open practices and associated administration is then outlined, including via the cumulative effects of administrative burden. It is argued that there is a high chance that without intervention, increased expectations to engage in open research practices may lead to unacceptable increases in demands on academics. Finally, the individual and systematic responsibilities to mitigate this are discussed.","tags":["workload model","workload creep","academic capitalism","data sharing","administration","burnout","preregistration","administrative burden","research policy","open research","open science","workload"],"date":"2023-02-17T10:10:37.880248","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/8xd65\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/8xd65\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8xd65","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8xd65","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_801"}
{"osf_id":"nv39u","title":"Best Practice Recommendations for Conducting Controlled Trials in Clinical Hypnosis Research","description":"There is an abundance of outcomes research for clinical hypnosis showing promising results, however, hypnosis is still underutilized in clinical care. For a behavioral intervention to enter mainstream clinical care, efficacy needs to be demonstrated with exceptionally high quality of evidence. Furthermore, the reporting of these studies also needs to be complete and sufficiently clear to show quality of evidence, and to enable replication and clinical use. The Task Force for Establishing Efficacy Standards for Clinical Hypnosis conducted a review of best practice guidelines in outcomes research, including a review of the CONSORT statement, TIDieR checklist, and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The present article provides best practice guidelines specific to conducting clinical hypnosis research. The guidelines comprise recommendations for planning, conducting, and reporting research in this field. \nThe recommendations are presented in two tiers. Tier I recommendations include essential best practices, such as a call for the use of detailed research and intervention manuals, plans for and reporting of participant-education about hypnosis, the use of hypnotizability scales with good psychometric properties, and clear reporting of the hypnotizability measurement. They also instruct for sharing of intervention scripts and manuals, and the clear reporting of the induction procedure, the labeling of the intervention for participants, and the definition of hypnosis used. Tier II includes preferred recommendations, calling for measurement of adherence to home practice, measurement of hypnotizability by someone other than the interventionist, the use of hypnotizability scales with both subjective and behavioral measures of responsiveness, and the involvement pf participants from the full hypnotizability spectrum. They also recommend the assessment of response expectancy, therapeutic relationship, and other variables related to proposed mechanisms of action, and the reporting of participants prior hypnosis experiences, and the relationship of expectancies and treatment outcomes.\nThis list of recommendations will be useful for researchers, reviewers, and journal editors alike when conducting, reporting, or evaluating studies involving clinical applications of hypnosis.","tags":["reporting guidelines","research methods","outcomes research","best practices","hypnosis"],"date":"2023-02-17T11:01:05.907087","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nv39u\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nv39u\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nv39u","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nv39u","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_802"}

Without formal training, patients adopt an unaffected region of the retina as a new fixation location, so-called \u2018preferred retinal locus\u2019 (PRL). However, learning to use the PRL as a reference location for saccades, i.e., saccadic re-referencing, is protracted and time-consuming. Recent studies showed that training with visual search tasks can expedite this process. However, visual search can be driven by salient external features- leading to efficient search, or by internal goals, usually leading to inefficient, attention-demanding search. We compared saccadic re-referencing (SR) training in the presence of a simulated central scotoma with either an efficient or an inefficient visual search task. Participants had to respond by fixating the target with an experimenter-defined retinal location in the lower visual field. We observed that comparable relative training gains were obtained in both tasks for a number of behavioral parameters, with higher training gains for the trained task, compared to the untrained task. The transfer to the untrained task was only observed for some parameters. Our findings thus confirm and extend previous research showing comparable efficiency for exogenously respectively endogenously driven visual search tasks for saccadic re-referencing training. Our results also show that transfer of training gains to related tasks may be limited and needs to be tested for SR-training paradigms to assess its suitability as a training tool for patients.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-17T11:50:55.648038","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Vision","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c9n5e\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/c9n5e\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/c9n5e","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c9n5e","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_803"}

Third, we replicated previous results and tested the construct validity (Study 2). Fourth, we ensured the criterion validity of the AAJCS (Study 3). The results suggested the existence of two independent factors, namely, approach and avoidance crafting, rather than a global job crafting factor. Furthermore, approach and avoidance crafting each consist of four job crafting dimensions, thus reflecting the hierarchical structure of job crafting. Within these dimensions, aspects of previous job crafting concepts are integrated. The distinction between approach and avoidance crafting became apparent in the comparison of their criterion validities as follows: approach crafting was positively related to work-related outcomes, while avoidance crafting was negatively associated with work engagement and performance. Furthermore, approach and avoidance crafting exhibited incremental validity with regard to predict work engagement and performance beyond previous job crafting concepts.

It consisted of 22 semi-structured interviews with autistic adults residing in the UK. The study used multiple methods of data collection. Interviews were transcribed, where appropriate, and thematically analysed.\n\nMultiple opinions are represented within this research, covering a number of topics, including the impact of historic and current practice on trust; ethical considerations such as the use of data in future studies; and representation of the autistic voice within research.","tags":["Genetics","Genomics","Qualitative","Co-Productive","Spectrum 10K","Autism"],"date":"2023-02-17T13:39:09.550481","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7x8cw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7x8cw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7x8cw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7x8cw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_806"}
{"osf_id":"aj7bz","title":"The signalling perspective of suicide explains divergent suicide and mental health trends during the COVID-19 pandemic","description":"A recent publication reports lower-than-expected or stabilized suicide rates across many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been proposed that these decreases and stabilizations in suicide rates are attributable to communities rallying together in difficult times. However, this claim conflicts with the finding that disorder-level anxiety and depression have increased during the pandemic. This brief commentary offers an alternative interpretation of these trends through Erwin Stengel\u2019s theory that suicide attempts are often a means for reviving crumbling interpersonal or romantic relationships. Stengel suggests that a suicide attempt is an appeal to the value held by others of the attempter\u2019s life. Accordingly, suicide will become rarer in times when the overall value of life within a society is lower, such as in times of war or genocide. This is because the reconciliatory power of suicide attempts diminishes in times when death is common. Stemming from this, Stengel made a specific prediction that increasing deathrates would correspond to dampening suicide rates. Factually, we have observed these exact trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, modern renditions of Stengel\u2019s theory (i.e., the signalling perspective of suicide) emphasise the importance of social networks in the causation of suicide. The pandemic has been disruptive to people\u2019s social networks (e.g., during quarantine periods), thus a dampening in suicide rates is expected. Naturally, the disintegration of social networks would be expected to cause distress\u2014but the signalling perspective uniquely predicts that this will also cause a dampening in suicide rates.","tags":["pandemic","COVID","bargaining model","COVID19","signalling perspective","suicide","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-02-17T14:00:08.005332","doi":null,"subjects":["Theory and Philosophy of Science","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/aj7bz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/aj7bz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/aj7bz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/aj7bz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_807"}
{"osf_id":"wyhqx","title":"Statistics in motion: Does the infant motor system predict actions based on their transitional probability?","description":"Motor theories of action prediction propose that our neural motor system combines prior knowledge about likely action outcomes with current sensory input to predict other people's behavior. This knowledge can be acquired through observational experience, more specifically statistical learning. Recently, it has been shown that infants can detect in a stream of actions two actions that follow each other deterministically and that their motor system uses this knowledge to predict upcoming actions. However, real-life actions are more complex: whereas actions hardly ever follow one another with 100% probability, often certain actions are more likely to follow one another than others (e.g., grasping a mug to drink versus to pass it to someone). Here, we examined whether infants can learn the statistical structure of action sequences through observation and whether the activity of their motor system reflects the specific statistical likelihood of upcoming actions. We trained 18-month-old infants at home with videos of action sequences featuring different transitional probabilities. At test, motor activity was measured using EEG during perceptually identical time windows that linked actions with four probability levels (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%). We found that motor activity was parametrically modulated by the transitional probability of action pairs. Specifically, our results showed the strongest predictive motor activity for deterministic actions and least activity for actions with low levels of probability. These results show that infants\u2019 predictive motor activity reflects the specific statistical likelihood of upcoming actions and thus underline the important role of statistical learning for infants\u2019 developing action understanding.","tags":["Infants' action understanding","Transitional probability","Mu rhythm","Statistical learning","Predictive processing","Action prediction"],"date":"2023-02-17T14:02:07.832109","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Developmental Neuroscience","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wyhqx\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wyhqx\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wyhqx","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wyhqx","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_808"}
{"osf_id":"4xur6","title":"The relevance of attention control, not working memory, in human factors","description":"Objective:  Discuss the human factors relevance of attention control (AC), a domain-general ability to regulate information processing functions in the service of goal-directed behavior.\nBackground: Working memory (WM) measures appear as predictors in various applied psychology studies. However, measures of WM reflect a mixture of memory storage and controlled attention making it difficult to interpret the meaning of significant WM-task relations for human factors.  In light of new research, complex task performance may be better predicted or explained with new measures of attention control rather than WM.  \nMethod: We briefly review the topic of individual differences in abilities in Human Factors.  Next, we focus on WM, how it is measured, and what can be inferred from significant WM-task relations.\nResults:  The theoretical underpinnings of attention control as a high-level factor that affects complex thought and behavior make it useful in human factors, which often study performance in complex and dynamic task environments.  To facilitate research on attention control in applied settings, we discuss a validated measure of attention control that predicts more variance in complex task performance than WM. In contrast to existing measures of WM or AC, our measures of attention control only require 3 minutes each (10 minutes total) and may be less culture-bound making them suitable for use in applied settings.\nConclusion:  Explaining or predicting task performance relations with attention control rather than WM may have dramatically different implications for designing more specific, equitable task interfaces, or training.\nApplication:  A highly efficient ability predictor can help researchers and practitioners better understand task requirements for human factors interventions or performance prediction.","tags":["multitasking","engineering psychology","human factors","attention control","working memory","ability\/performance"],"date":"2023-02-17T14:12:37.046996","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Engineering Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4xur6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4xur6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4xur6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4xur6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_809"}
{"osf_id":"wurd6","title":"A Theoretical Model to Explain Mixed Effects of Trust Repair Strategies in Autonomous Systems","description":"The topic of an autonomous system initiating trust repair has generated intense interest from researchers and has led to a stream of empirical works studying the impact of different trust repair strategies.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a clear pattern of results or systematicity in the experimental manipulations. This is likely due to a lack of a coherent model or theoretical framework of trust repair.  We present a possible theoretical model that may explain and predict how different trust repair strategies may work with different autonomous systems, in different situations, and with different people.  We have adapted and applied a well-established social cognition theory that has successfully explained and predicted complex attitudinal and behavioural phenomena.  The model suggests that significant variance in trust repair results may be partly due to individual differences (e.g., motivation, cognitive abilities), which have not been extensively examined in the literature, and confounded or uncontrolled study parameters (e.g., timing of trust measurement, repair frequency, workload).  We hope that this theoretical model stimulates discussion toward a more theory-driven trust repair research agenda to understand basic underlying mechanisms.","tags":["automation","autonomy","trust repair","human-robot interaction","individual differences","hri"],"date":"2023-02-17T14:21:17.182458","doi":"10.1080\/1463922X.2023.2250424","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Engineering Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wurd6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wurd6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wurd6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wurd6","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/1463922X.2023.2250424","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_810"}

Similar to image scrambling, the scrambling of auditory signals aims at creating stimulus instances that are not recognizable but have comparable low-level features. In the present study, we generated scrambled stimuli of short vocalizations taken from the Mon-treal Affective Voices database (Belin et al., 2008, Behav Res Methods, 40) by applying four different scrambling methods (frequency-, phase-, and two time-scrambling transformations). The original stimuli and scrambled versions were judged by N = 60 participants for the appar-ency of a human voice, gender, and valence of the expressions, or if no human voice was de-tected, for the valence of the subjective response toward the stimulus. The human-likeness rat-ings were reduced for all scrambled versions compared to the original stimuli, albeit to a lesser degree for phase-scrambled versions of neutral bursts. For phase-scrambled neutral bursts, va-lence ratings were equivalent to the ratings of the original neutral burst. All other scrambled versions were rated as slightly unpleasant, indicating that they should be used with caution due to their potential aversiveness.","tags":["phase","frequency","scrambling","affect bursts","valence","validation","auditory"],"date":"2023-02-17T16:07:36.389905","doi":null,"subjects":["Audition","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7u6sm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7u6sm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7u6sm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7u6sm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_811"}

I examined personality thoroughly using the three-level model: personality traits, characteristic adaptations, and narrative identity. I further described recent developments in dynamic personality research, which expands static personality traits to incorporate intraindividual processes of personality and emotional states. I presented relevant findings in each area and provided the theoretical background on relationship science to help guide readers in interpreting these patterns of results. In sum, assortative mating is a strong and consistent phenomenon in various domains, including demographic variables and social, political, and spiritual attitudes. Not only are couples generally much more similar than non-couples, but this similarity is predictive of important indicators of relationship quality. On the other hand, the literature is much more mixed for personality traits and emotional processes. I argue that this is partly due to the dominance of traits in personality research, for which the preponderance of evidence favored the actor or partner effects over a dyadic effect; that is, an individual\u2019s or their partner\u2019s personality traits are predictive of their relationship initiation and quality, but their similarity\/dissimilarity is not. Nonetheless, other personality constructs, such as values, attitudes, attachment, coping, and motivational units, show much more promising dyadic patterns. In expanding our conceptualization of personality to include constructs across all three levels, we will see that personality as a whole is indeed an important factor in the assortative mating process.","tags":["attachment","relationship science","assortative mating","three-level model of personality","personality","longitudinal data","personality dynamics"],"date":"2023-02-17T16:10:41.616397","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Individual Differences","Personality Processes","Interpersonal Relationships","Affect and Emotion Regulation","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c3q7x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/c3q7x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/c3q7x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c3q7x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_812"}

However, AVH also occur in a small percentage of the general population who do not have a need for care, termed nonclinical voice hearers (NCVH). We sought to determine the degree to which the experience of AVH was similar in NCVH and in people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and evaluate the degree to which NCVH shared other features of schizophrenia such as delusional beliefs, cognitive impairment, and negative symptoms.\nStudy design: We recruited 76 people with a DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia\/schizoaffective disorder (PSZ; 49 with current AVH, 27 without), 48 NCVH, and 51 healthy controls. Participants received a broad battery of clinician-administered and self-report symptom assessments and a focused cognitive assessment.\nStudy Results: The AVH of NCVH and PSZ shared very similar sensory features. NCVH experienced less distress, had greater control over their AVH, and, unlike PSZ, rarely heard two voices speaking to each other. NCVH demonstrated a wide range of deeply-held unusual beliefs, but reported less paranoia, and fewer first-rank symptoms such as passivity and alterations in self-experience. NCVH showed no evidence of cognitive deficits or negative symptoms.\nConclusions: The AVH in NCVH and PSZ demonstrate important similarities as well as clear differences. Specific features, rather than the presence, of AVH appear to determine the need for care. NCVH do not share the cognitive and motivational deficits seen in PSZ. These results suggest that AVH and unusual beliefs can be separated from the broader phenotype of SZ.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-17T16:39:21.210461","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Neuroscience","Psychiatry","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cps4z\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cps4z\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cps4z","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cps4z","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_814"}

The best performing models were then analyzed in terms of their data requirements and scaling, subject specificity and the space-time structure of their predicted dynamics.\nWe found the Chebnets, a type of graph convolutional neural network, to be best suited for BOLD auto-regression, closely followed by linear models. Chebnets demonstrated an increase in performance with increasing amounts of data, with no complete saturation at 9 h of training data. Significant subject specificity was found at short prediction time lags. The Chebnets were found to capture lower frequencies at longer prediction time lags, and the spatial correlations in predicted dynamics were found to match traditional functional connectivity networks.\nOverall, these results demonstrate that large individual fMRI datasets can be used to efficiently train purely individual auto-regressive models of brain activity, and that massive amounts of individual data are required to do so. The excellent performance of the Chebnets likely reflects their ability to combine spatial and temporal interactions on large time scales at a low complexity cost. \nIndividual auto-regressive models have the potential to improve our understanding of the functional interactions in the human brain. This study is based on a massive, publicly-available dataset, which can serve for future benchmarks of individual auto-regressive modeling.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-17T18:36:19.116712","doi":null,"subjects":["Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pvx3d\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pvx3d\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pvx3d","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pvx3d","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_815"}

The family-specific effects of pre-registered (https:\/\/osf.io\/7n2jx\/) Dynamic Structural Equation Models (DSEM) indeed revealed that a reciprocal day-to-day association between parenting and adolescent affective well-being was found only in some families, with the proportion of families displaying a reciprocal association varying across the four parenting dimensions (11% to 55%). In other families, either parenting predicted the adolescent\u2019s affective well-being (8%-43%) or vice versa\n(10%-27%), or no day-to-day associations were found (16%-60%).

Using an attentional bias (AB) task with both pain and opioid cues, we evaluated a cognitive bias modification (CBM) task administered during regularly scheduled medications for OUD (mOUD) dosing visits. The current study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the CBM task. Outcomes for AB tasks used traditional mean-based score and trial-level bias scores (TLBS). \nMethods: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 28 individuals with OUD and chronic pain engaged in mOUD were randomized to either CBM or an AB control condition and completed up to three tasks per week for four weeks. Standard AB task was completed at baseline and post-treatment. Participants completed feasibility and acceptability measures, and preliminary efficacy (i.e., change in AB) was assessed using ANOVA models. \nResults: Participants attended 83.3% of scheduled sessions and generally reported the task was enjoyable, credible, and easy to complete. Preliminary results demonstrated a condition by time interaction highlighting a reduction in AB in the CBM group but not the control group in opioid TLBS variability (F[1,26]=5.01, p=.034) and pain TLBS towards (F[1,26]=6.42, p=.018) and pain TLBS variability (F[1,26]=5.24, p=.03). \nConclusions: The current study supports integrating brief, computer-based tasks designed to reduce AB into mOUD clinical care.

It is suggested that this research strategy may narrow the scientist-practitioner gap and make it easier to demonstrate differential outcomes of different treatments.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-17T23:09:53.532276","doi":"10.1037\/\/0003-066x.46.2.99","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other","Psychotherapy","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gxtzj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gxtzj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gxtzj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gxtzj","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/\/0003-066x.46.2.99","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_821"}

We report on a validation study of a common variant of the task as a measure of thought style in cultural psychology, following the three phases of validity (Loevinger, 1957). With the use of item response theory, we found support for a unidimensional construct in one American and one Chinese sample, but the measure showed other suboptimal psychometric properties. We subsequently improved the measure via item development, instruction modification, and invariance testing in three additional American samples. As a result, we found the expected within-culture differences. Buttressing the validity evidence of the triad measure reduces the threat of measurement-related alternative explanations and thus facilitates more valid group comparisons.","tags":["item response theory","triad task","analytic and holistic thinking","validity evidence"],"date":"2023-02-18T00:03:47.298600","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cultural Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6jwd8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6jwd8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6jwd8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6jwd8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_822"}
{"osf_id":"d843p","title":"The impact and perceived effectiveness of physical punishment: A qualitative study of young adults\u2019 retrospective accounts","description":"Background: Physical discipline is a widely-studied parenting practice given its association with numerous negative outcomes, such as increased aggression and poor parent-child relationships. While research on this topic has been steadily growing, most studies have utilised quantitative data obtained from parents\u2019 perspectives on the topic. As such, less is known about the heterogeneous experiences of children who had received physical punishment which may be better represented in qualitative feedback. \nObjective: This study aims to retrospectively explore the experience of having been physically disciplined from first-hand accounts.\nParticipants: 25 young adults aged 18 to 24 (M = 21.4; female = 14) who had received physical discipline by their parents in the past were interviewed about their experiences over a video call. \nMethods: Interviews were conducted to explore participants\u2019 experiences of parental discipline (physical and non-physical). Thematic analysis was conducted where the interviews were transcribed and coded, before being examined for concepts underlying the codes (\u201cthemes\u201d). \nResults: Based on participants\u2019 interviews, four themes were identified in relation to their experiences of physical punishment: 1) Unclear distinctions between physical discipline and abuse; 2) Negative consequences and the ineffectiveness of physical discipline; 3) Rationalising past experiences of physical discipline; 4) Negative past experiences of physical discipline does not preclude future use. \nConclusions: The use of qualitative data provided rich insights into the nuances of receiving physical punishment. The four themes identified in this study were discussed in relation to existing literature. Implications of physical punishment on children\u2019s mental health, as well as the importance of advocacy and legislation around physical punishment were highlighted.","tags":["Discipline","Thematic analysis","Intergenerational","Physical punishment","Qualitative"],"date":"2023-02-18T15:22:26.198656","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/d843p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/d843p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/d843p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/d843p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_823"}

Thus, we examined whether depressive symptoms at admission would predict weight change from admission to discharge in a large sample of inpatients with AN. In addition, we also explored the reverse direction, that is, whether body mass index (BMI) at admission would predict changes in depressive symptoms. A sample of 3011 adolescents and adults with AN (4% male) who received inpatient treatment at four Schoen Clinics was analyzed. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20139. BMI significantly increased and depressive symptoms significantly decreased from admission to discharge. BMI and depressive symptoms were unrelated at admission. Higher BMI at admission predicted smaller decreases in depressive symptoms and higher depressive symptoms at admission predicted larger weight gain. The latter effect, however, was mediated by longer length of stay. Results indicate that depressive symptoms do not adversely affect weight gain during inpatient treatment in persons with AN. Instead, higher BMI at admission is predictive of smaller improvements in depressive symptoms but this effect seems to be negligible in terms of clinical relevance.","tags":["Depression","Anorexia nervosa","Body mass index","Weight gain","Inpatient treatment"],"date":"2023-02-18T15:52:39.048084","doi":"10.1016\/j.jpsychores.2023.111391","subjects":["Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Feeding and Eating Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j3qb9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j3qb9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j3qb9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j3qb9","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpsychores.2023.111391","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_824"}

Humans have demonstrated partial access to the properties that make a given stimulus more or less memorable. Recently, a deep neural network named ResMem was shown to successfully decode the memorability of visual stimuli as well. However, it remains unknown whether ResMem\u2019s predictions of memorability reflect the influence of stimulus-intrinsic properties or other stimulus-extrinsic factors that are known to induce inter-individual consistency in memory performance (e.g., inter-stimulus similarity). Additionally, it is not clear whether ResMem and humans share access to overlapping properties of memorability. Here, in three experiments, we show that ResMem predicts stimulus-intrinsic memorability independent of stimulus-extrinsic factors, and that it captures aspects of memorability that are inaccessible to human observers. Taken together, our results confirm the multifaceted nature of memorability and establish a method for isolating its unconscious aspects.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-18T16:11:36.736864","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/urz5s\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/urz5s\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/urz5s","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/urz5s","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_825"}

It is imperative to understand how this daily activity impacts well-being. Here, we reveal that the affective properties of the knowledge sought influences well-being, which in turn alters knowledge-seeking, forming a self-reinforcing loop. We first quantified the affective properties of text on webpages that participants (N=947) chose to browse and found that browsing more negative information was associated with worse mental-health and mood. Next, by manipulating the webpages browsed and measuring mood and vice versa, we show that the relationship is causal and bi-directional. Finally, we developed an intervention that successfully altered web-browsing patterns in a manner consistent with improving well-being. Together, the findings suggest that the knowledge sought reflects mental state and shapes it, creating a feedback loop that may perpetuate mental health problems. The results also provide a potential method for assessing and enhancing welfare in the digital age.","tags":["Happiness","Wellbeing","Information-seeking","Mental Health","Web browsing"],"date":"2023-02-18T22:28:29.266966","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yd6j5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yd6j5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yd6j5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yd6j5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_827"}

The current study aimed to fill this gap using a pre-post experimental design embedded within a 29-day dyadic diary framework. After two weeks of providing baseline data concerning feelings of intimacy and passion, ease of sexual communication, and sexual and relationship satisfaction, participating mixed-sex couples (N = 128) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a control condition in which couples were not asked to engage in novel sexual activities; a sexual position condition in which couples were asked to try out five novel sexual positions; or a vibrator condition in which couples were asked to use a novel vibrator while engaging in five new sexual positions. Couples then provided assessments of the same relationship quality indicators that had been baselined over the course of two weeks. Passion was significantly higher among participants in the vibrator condition than participants in the control condition immediately following the intervention but declined back to baseline levels by the end of study. No other differences in the relationship quality indicators were found across the conditions.  These results suggest that sexual novelty may have short-term effects on passion, though these effects are transitory and unrelated to other aspects of sexual and relationship quality.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-19T10:07:47.058709","doi":null,"subjects":["Sexuality","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wf8je\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wf8je\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wf8je","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wf8je","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_829"}

In five pre-registered experiments (N = 1195), we show there are two kinds of counterfactual closeness. These two kinds of closeness are inferred from different causes, elicit different emotions, and are described using different linguistic expressions. Distance-based closeness is inferred from the distance between the counterfactual and reality, is expressed by saying the counterfactual almost happened, and is more strongly linked with disappointment than surprise. Meanwhile, odds-based closeness is inferred from prior odds, is expressed by saying the counterfactual easily could have happened, and is more strongly linked with surprise. Even without information about the distance between outcomes and prior odds, people more strongly link expressions of whether something almost happened with disappointment and link expressions of whether something easily could have happened with surprise. In sum, counterfactual closeness is not perceived on a single dimension. Instead, there are at least two forms of closeness.","tags":["cognition","counterfactuals","probability","judgment","emotion"],"date":"2023-02-19T17:23:44.676247","doi":"10.1037\/xge0001369","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/h9ypd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/h9ypd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/h9ypd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/h9ypd","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/xge0001369","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_831"}

Aha moments have properties that can be exploited by conspiracy theories, such as the potential for false but seemingly grounded conclusions.

A Randomized Trial Examining the Role of Meditation Frequency When Total Amount of Meditation is Held Constant","description":"Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps. However, the optimal dosing of app-delivered meditation practice has not been established. We examined whether the distribution of meditation practices across a day impacted outcomes in a distressed population. We investigated the effects of meditation practice frequency in a two-week compassion-based meditation intervention delivered via the Healthy Minds Program app. Undergraduates with clinically elevated depression and\/or anxiety (n = 351) were randomized to a Massed (one 20-minute meditation per day) or Distributed condition (two 10-minute meditations per day). Psychological distress (primary outcome; composite of depression and anxiety), experiential avoidance, fear of missing out, loneliness, and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Psychological distress, loneliness, and informal meditation practice were also assessed daily. Practice time and frequency were assessed using app data. Results support feasibility of the study design, success of the manipulation, and acceptability of the intervention. Pooled across conditions, participants exhibited pre-post improvements on all outcomes (absolute value of ds = 0.12 to 0.63, ps \u2264 .010) and trajectories of improvement on daily distress and loneliness (ps \u2264 .010). No between-group differences were observed on changes in pre-post or daily measures (ps =.158 to .729). When total amount of meditation practice per day is held constant, the distribution of practice may not influence outcomes for distressed beginners. Although only a first test of dose frequency effects, findings support flexibility in the distribution of meditation throughout the day, which may increase accessibility.","tags":["meditation","lovingkindness","compassion","mobile health","dosage"],"date":"2023-02-19T22:40:59.750760","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychotherapy","Depressive Disorders","Intervention Research","Anxiety Disorders","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rj4vu\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rj4vu\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rj4vu","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rj4vu","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_835"}
{"osf_id":"c8d25","title":"Psychogenetic Risk-Markers for Developing Anorexia Nervosa","description":"Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN), which typically affects female adolescents, is characterized by aberrant patterns of eating behavior, disturbances in attitudes toward and perceptions of weight and shape, and by a relentless pursuit of thinness and obsessive fears of gaining weight despite emaciation. AN is often develops into a chronic, relapsing illness. Statistics show that the annual mortality rate for anorexia nervosa is 5-6%, with suicide the second most common cause of death after medical complications. Therefore, early detection and medical-psychological intervention are of major importance for a favorable outcome.\nSince there are contributory genetic factors for AN I have designed a study to examine whether women suffering from AN are characterized by specific genetic characteristics: the complex configurations of ridges and creases on the skin surface of digits and palms. Positive results will show that these characteristics can contribute to the detection of individuals who are prone to develop AN. Notwithstanding the popular image of \"fortune-tellers\", scientific studies on epidermal configurations have been conducted for over two centuries. This field of inquiry is termed Dermatoglyphics.\nMethod: Dermatoglyphic prints of fingers and palms were obtained from women in various stages of AN, and compared with those of healthy women.\nResults:  A clear difference could be seen between the dermatoglyphic characteristics of women suffering from AN and healthy individuals. Hence, the aim of the research was achieved.\nConclusions: The observed dermatoglyphic characteristics warrant replication for refinement. Moreover, since AN has serious medical consequences as well as a negative psychological impact, there is clearly an urgent need to implement the results in the form of an objective dermatoglyphic screening test, along with the currently available screening tests.","tags":["dermatoglyphics","screening test","anorexia nervosa"],"date":"2023-02-19T23:20:53.903312","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Feeding and Eating Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/c8d25\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/c8d25\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/c8d25","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/c8d25","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_836"}
{"osf_id":"r6bw9","title":"The Inventory of Nonordinary Experiences (INOE): Evidence of Validity in the United States and India","description":"Researchers increasingly recognize that the mind and culture interact at many levels to constitute our lived experience, yet we know relatively little about the extent to which culture shapes the way people appraise their experiences and the likelihood that a given experience will be reported.  Experiences that involve claims regarding deities, extraordinary abilities, and\/or psychopathology offer an important site for investigating the interplay of mind and culture at the population level. However, the difficulties inherent in comparing culture-laden experiences, exacerbated by the siloing of research on experiences based on discipline-specific theoretical constructs, have limited our ability to do so.  We introduce the Inventory of Nonordinary Experiences (INOE), which allows researchers to compare experiences by separating the phenomenological features from how they are appraised and asking about both.  It thereby offers a new means of investigating the potentially universal (etic) and culture-specific (emic) aspects of lived experiences. To ensure that the INOE survey items are understood as intended by English speakers in the US and Hindi speakers in India, and thus can serve as a basis for cross-cultural comparison, we used the Response Process Evaluation (RPE) method to collect evidence of item-level validity. Our inability to validate some items drawn from other surveys suggests that they are capturing a wider range of experiences than researchers intend. Wider use of the RPE method would increase the likelihood that survey results are due to the differences that researchers intend to measure.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-19T23:25:21.002556","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Testing and Assessment","Cultural Differences","Cross-cultural Psychology","Religion and Spirituality","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r6bw9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r6bw9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r6bw9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r6bw9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_837"}

Past work has shown that people use different forms of uncertainty to guide exploration. In this study, we investigate the role of the pupil-linked arousal system in uncertainty-guided exploration. We measured participants\u2019 pupil dilation (N = 48) while they performed a two- armed bandit task. Consistent with previous work, we found that people adopted a hybrid of directed, random and undirected exploration, which are sensitive to relative uncertainty, total uncertainty and value difference between options, respectively. We also found a positive correlation between pupil size and total uncertainty. Furthermore, augmenting the choice model with subject-specific total uncertainty estimates decoded from the pupil size improved predictions of held-out choices, suggesting that people used the uncertainty estimate encoded in pupil size to decide which option to explore Together, the data shed light on the computations underlying uncertainty-driven exploration. Under the assumption that pupil size reflects Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine (LC-NE) neuromodulatory activity, these results also extend the theory of LC-NE function in exploration, highlighting its selective role in driving uncertainty- guided random exploration.","tags":["exploration","uncertainty","pupil","reinforcement learning","decision-making","LC-NE"],"date":"2023-02-20T04:16:36.272840","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jnu45\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jnu45\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jnu45","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jnu45","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_838"}

In particular, it is essential to have confidence in the validity of these measures if we want to fight effectively against conspiracism.

Negative relationships were especially pronounced between alexithymia and the mindfulness facets of Describing, Non-Judgement, and Acting with Awareness . This indicates that individual differences in these mindfulness facets might be more firmly rooted in difficulties identifying and describing emotions compared to emotional beliefs aimed at suppression captured by stoic ideology. While the mindfulness facets showed overall expected patterns of relationships with both alexithymia and stoic ideology, Non-Reacting showed a divergent pattern. Non-Reacting was positively related to a tendency of General External Oriented Thought, as well as with Death-Acceptance, in both countries. Thus, this facet might not only capture non-reactance in a mindfulness sense, but could also potentially capture aspects of emotional avoidance.\nConclusions Overall, the study highlights that mindfulness could be influenced by both individual differences in emotion processing and cognitive beliefs about emotion processing. This accentuates the importance of examining both individual differences and cognitive beliefs about emotion regulation in subsequent research regarding mindfulness.","tags":["alexithymia","cross-cultural","stoic ideology","mindfulness","network"],"date":"2023-02-20T12:40:21.853576","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cross-cultural Psychology","Cultural Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tx5g8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tx5g8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tx5g8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tx5g8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_841"}

Younger and older adults performed the Word Recall test and differences in the delayed recall performance were explored. A similar pattern of retrieval dynamics was found with a larger primacy effect for both groups and a reduced temporal contiguity effect for older adults relative to the younger group. Significant differences were found when comparing the semantic memory network structures, with older adults presenting a less flexible and small-world-like structure. The third set of analyses explored subgroups of participants implementing idiosyncratic strategies and their impact on recall accuracy. Two subgroups relying on diverted processes from the average data were found for young and older adults, and the subgroup adopting non-temporal associations presented subtle differences among the two age groups. The participants that adopted temporal associations in a forward direction presented the highest recall performance compared with other strategies. We concluded that a reduced ability to reinstate temporal context information to guide retrieval and differences in semantic memory network structure account for deficits in episodic memory observed in older adults. This study provides evidence that the principles of memory search may not be universal as subgroups of participants adopting idiosyncratic strategies were revealed.","tags":["aging","free recall","temporal contiguity effect","semantic memory","episodic memory"],"date":"2023-02-20T13:38:51.337027","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rgfuh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rgfuh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rgfuh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rgfuh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_842"}

{"osf_id":"5e8mg","title":"Cognitive offloading is value-based decision making: Modelling cognitive effort and the expected value of memory","description":"How do people decide between maintaining information in short-term memory or offloading it to external reminders? How does this affect subsequent memory? This article presents a simple computational model based on two principles: A) items stored in brain-based memory occupy its limited capacity, generating an opportunity cost; B) reminders incur a small physical-action cost, but capacity is effectively unlimited. These costs are balanced against the value of remembering,  which determines the optimal strategy. Simulations reproduce many empirical findings, including: 1) preferential offloading of high-value items; 2) increased offloading at higher memory loads ; 3) \u2018Google effect\u2019: reduced brain-based memory for offloaded items; 4) \u2018saving-enhanced memory\u2019: improved memory for non-offloaded items as a result of offloading other items; 5) reduced saving-enhanced-memory effect when reminders are unreliable; 6) influence of item-value: people may preferentially offload high-value items and store additional low-value items in brain-based memory; 7) greatest sensitivity to the effort of reminder-setting at intermediate rather than highest\/lowest levels of task difficulty. Therefore, value-based decision-making provides a simple unifying account of many cognitive offloading phenomena. These results are consistent with an opportunity-cost model of cognitive effort, which can explain why internal memory feels effortful but reminders do not.","tags":["memory","reward","value","reinforcement learning","decision-making","cognitive offloading"],"date":"2023-02-20T14:37:14.529517","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5e8mg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5e8mg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5e8mg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5e8mg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_844"}

However, target dress is notably absent from current theories and models of person perception. We discuss three reasons for this minimal attention to dress in person perception: high theoretical complexity, incompatibility with traditional methodology, and underappreciation by the groups who have historically guided research in person perception. We propose a working model of person perception that incorporates target dress alongside target face, target body, context, and perceiver characteristics. Then, we identify four types of inferences for which perceivers rely on target dress: social categories, cognitive states, status, and aesthetics. For each of these, we review relevant work in social cognition, integrate this work with existing dress research, and propose future directions. Finally, we identify and offer solutions to the theoretical and methodological challenges accompanying the psychological study of dress.","tags":["first impressions","style","clothing","social cognition","social status","aesthetics","fashion","social categorization","theory of mind"],"date":"2023-02-20T15:50:32.252251","doi":null,"subjects":["Impression Formation","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/avm36\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/avm36\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/avm36","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/avm36","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_845"}

{"osf_id":"u5jpb","title":"Acquiring recursive structures through distributional learning","description":"Languages differ regarding the depth, structure, and syntactic domains of recursive structures. Even within a single language, some structures allow infinite self-embedding while others are more restricted.  For example, when expressing ownership relation, English allows infinite embedding of the prenominal genitive -s, whereas the postnominal genitive of is much more restricted. How do speakers learn which specific structures allow infinite embedding and which do not? The distributional learning proposal suggests that the recursion of a structure (e.g., X1\u2019s-X2) is licensed if the X1 position and the X2 position are productively substitutable in non-recursive input. The present study tests this proposal with an artificial language learning experiment. We exposed adult participants to X1-ka-X2 strings. In the productive condition, almost all words attested in X1 position were also attested in X2 position; in the unproductive condition, only some were. We found that, as predicted, participants from the productive condition were more likely to accept unattested strings at both one- and two-embedding levels than participants from the unproductive condition. Our results suggest that speakers can use distributional information at one-embedding level to learn whether or not a structure is recursive.","tags":["recursion","distributional learning","artificial language","language acquisition"],"date":"2023-02-20T17:11:59.433827","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Linguistics","Cognitive Psychology","Language Aquisition","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/u5jpb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/u5jpb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/u5jpb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/u5jpb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_847"}

This service evaluation extends previous research into guided self-help (GSH) for adults with bulimic spectrum EDs by assessing uptake, completion, and clinical outcomes when using an innovative delivery method, i.e., videoconferencing.\nMethods: Patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED) waiting for treatment in a large specialist adult eating disorder outpatient service were offered virtually-delivered GSH. The programme used an evidence-based cognitive-behavioural self-help book. Individuals were supported by non-expert coaches, who delivered the programme virtually via video call.\nResults: Of 130 patients allocated to a GSH coach, 106 (81.5%) started and 75 (57.7%) completed treatment. Amongst completers, there were large reductions in ED behaviours and attitudinal symptoms measured by the ED-15. The largest effect sizes were seen in the frequency of binge eating behaviour (-0.93) and concerns around eating (-1.59). Patients from minoritised ethnic groups were overrepresented in the non-completers group.\nConclusions: This service evaluation provides encouraging preliminary evidence for virtually-delivered GSH as a treatment for BN, BED, and OSFED. It appears effective as a simple, short-term, focused intervention against the backdrop of long waiting lists for ED treatment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to compare GSH to other brief therapies and investigate barriers for patients from culturally diverse groups.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-20T18:15:59.435010","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xuyv8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xuyv8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xuyv8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xuyv8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_848"}

Yet, with this increase in studies, there comes the desire to draw broader conclusions across datasets about the nature and instantiation of time in the human brain. In the absence of collating individual studies together, the field has employed the use of Coordinate-Based Meta-Analyses (CBMA), in which foci from individual studies are modeled as probability distributions within the brain, from which common areas of activation-likelihood are determined. This chapter provides an overview of these CBMA studies, the methods they employ, the conclusions drawn by them, and where future areas of inquiry lie. The result of this survey suggests the existence of a domain-general \u201ctiming network\u201d that can be used both as a guide for individual neuroimaging studies and a template for future meta-analyses.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-20T19:42:12.121431","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rgv5c\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rgv5c\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rgv5c","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rgv5c","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_849"}

Severe anxiety is associated with substantial negative impacts on everyday functioning and well-being and is closely linked with the development of other mental illnesses, such as depression. Anxiety can be driven by a range of societal, financial and ecological factors \u2013 including poverty, unemployment\/precarious employment, inequality, discrimination, physical environmental features such as housing quality, overcrowding and pollution, as well as crises such as COVID-19, political turmoil and conflict  \u2013 many of which disproportionally affect young people. \nWe propose that these contextual factors can be conceptually grouped as the \u2018anxiogenic\u2019 environment, one that engenders the emergence and maintenance of anxiety. Explicitly describing, defining and investigating the anxiogenic environment allows a re-examination of the contextual drivers of anxiety, shifting focus from an individual, biologically-based model to one that also considers the individual within their social, informational and environmental contexts. Just as Swinburne and colleagues\u2019 labelling of the \u2018obesogenic environment\u2019 supported a recognition of the contextual drivers of obesity, we suggest that consideration of the anxiogenic environment can allow a reframing of the discussion and promote shifts in understanding, advocacy, research, treatment and funding.

{"osf_id":"zrqdm","title":"Examining the facets of mindful engagement and mind wandering in nature","description":"Mindfulness and mind wandering may both enhance the psychological outcomes of nature experiences. Both states are multi-faceted, with mindfulness involving specific components such as decentering, body awareness, and nonjudgment, and mind wandering involving intentional and spontaneous mind wandering. These facets may differentially predict psychological outcomes of nature experiences, however these associations have not been tested. In this study we examined facets of mindfulness and mind wandering in nature and tested their associations with outcomes of psychological restoration and nature connection. We also tested the effects of different environmental and personal circumstances on these engagement facets in nature. We conducted an experiment in which participants were instructed on how to engage with nature during a 20min outdoor experience and completed online surveys before and after the outdoor experience. Participants were allocated into one of four groups, each given different engagement instructions. Through an exploratory factor analysis, we found that the measure of state mindfulness assessed three facets \u2013 decentering, noticing and accepting the internal experience, and body awareness, and the measure of mind wandering assessed two facets \u2013 mindlessness, and pleasant mind wandering. Regression analyses revealed associations between these facets and outcomes of the nature experience: decentering, body awareness, and pleasant mind wandering were generally associated with positive outcomes, and mindlessness and noticing and accepting the internal experience were associated with poorer outcomes relating to negative affect and attention performance. Further analyses revealed environmental and personal contextual factors that influenced engagement during the nature experience. These results demonstrate the value of deconstructing mindfulness and mind wandering in nature to explore facets that have beneficial or adverse effects on psychological outcomes. We conclude with practical directions for nature-based engagement interventions that can target the beneficial components of these practices in different contexts.","tags":["attention","restoration","mind wandering","mindfulness","nature connection","nature experience"],"date":"2023-02-20T22:31:35.786865","doi":null,"subjects":["Natural Environments","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology","Built Environments"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zrqdm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zrqdm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zrqdm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zrqdm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_852"}

Mediation, confounding, and colliding are three key third-variable effects that yield different theoretical and methodological implications for drawing causal inferences. Commonly used covariance-based statistical methods, such as linear regression and structural equation modeling, cannot distinguish these effects in practice, however. In this study, we introduce a statistical approach for distinguishing mediators, confounders, and colliders that uses higher-order moment information from the data. We propose a two-step procedure that uses the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) within the Direction Dependence Analysis (DDA) framework. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed approach accurately recovers the true data-generating process of the third variable. We provide an empirical example to demonstrate the application of our proposed approach in psychological research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions of our work.","tags":["Collider","Direction Dependence Analysis (DDA)","Mediator","Causal inference","Confounder"],"date":"2023-02-21T01:34:59.655565","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/v456y\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/v456y\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/v456y","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/v456y","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_853"}

There has been a significant increase in interest surrounding ayahuasca since the turn of the millennium. Increasing numbers of tourists are travelling to the Amazon rainforest to drink the brew, with various media outlets, celebrities, and researchers describing benefits from its consumption. Ayahuasca is now present across the globe and retreat centres offering plant medicine experiences has become a thriving business. Anecdotal evidence varies significantly, ranging from evangelical accounts to horror stories involving physical and psychological harm. The effects of the brew on personality, mental health outcomes, and nature-relatedness are discussed in this review. Further, phenomenological analyses of the ayahuasca experience are explored.

However, these policies reduced social interactions and may have had a negative impact on well-being. As physical distancing policies might alter individual perceptions of social connectedness, this might influence individual perceptions of received social support and well-being. However, the relationships of changes in social connectedness with different social relationships, received social support, and well-being during the pandemic have not been fully investigated. Thus, in this study, we examined (a) the relationship between received social support and well-being, (b) the relationships between changes in social connectedness to family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors and well-being, (c) the relationships between changes in social connectedness and well-being through received social support, and (d) whether the relationships of changes in social connectedness, received social support, and well-being are similar or different across countries. In this study, data from a total of 16,685 individuals from 49 countries were analyzed using multilevel and multilevel mediation models. The results showed that both received support and increases in social connectedness positively predicted well-being. Moreover, received support partially mediated the relationship of changes in social connectedness to family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors with well-being. These relationships were similar across countries. These findings highlighted the importance of received support and social connectedness to both close and more distant relationships for enhancing well-being in diverse populations during stressful situations.","tags":["well-being","social support","received social support","COVID-19"],"date":"2023-02-21T02:27:04.614137","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wvk9h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wvk9h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wvk9h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wvk9h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_855"}

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a framework that summarizes the substantial and growing body of quantitative evidence on the structure of psychopathology. To achieve its aims, HiTOP must incorporate emerging research in a systematic, ongoing fashion. In this paper, we describe the historical context and grounding of the principles and procedures for revising the HiTOP framework. Informed by strengths and shortcomings of previous classification systems, the proposed revisions protocol is a formalized system focused around three pillars: 1) prioritizing systematic evaluation of quantitative evidence by a set of transparent criteria and processes, 2) balancing stability with flexibility, and 3) promoting inclusion over gatekeeping in all aspects of the process. We detail how the revisions protocol will be applied in practice, including the scientific and administrative aspects of the process. Additionally, we describe areas of the HiTOP structure that will be a focus of early revisions and outline challenges for the revisions protocol moving forward. The proposed revisions protocol is designed to ensure that the HiTOP framework reflects the current state of scientific knowledge on the structure of psychopathology and fulfils its potential to advance clinical research and practice.","tags":["nosology","psychopathology","classification","HiTOP","psychiatry"],"date":"2023-02-21T03:56:56.736014","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xr48p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xr48p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xr48p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xr48p","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_857"}

Contrary to this approach, it has been proposed that conspiracy theories targeting relatively powerful groups (i.e., upward conspiracy theories) may be ideologically distinct from conspiracy theories targeting relatively powerless groups (i.e., downward conspiracy theories). We tested this contention in the Romanian context (n = 723, preregistered), and compared the ideological and socioeconomic correlates of anti-government (i.e., a relatively powerful group) and anti-Roma (i.e., a relatively powerless group) conspiracy beliefs. Using Principal Components Analysis, we showed that both categories of conspiracy beliefs are statistically distinct. Right Wing Authoritarianism was significantly more related to anti-Roma conspiracy beliefs than to anti-government conspiracy beliefs. However, against our expectations, both types of conspiracy beliefs did not relate differently to subjective socioeconomic status. Overall, the ideological discrepancies between upward and downward conspiracy beliefs were less marked in the Romanian context. Finally, conspiracy mentality was more related to anti-government conspiracy beliefs than anti-Roma conspiracy beliefs. This corroborates the notion that generic measurements of conspiracist ideation may be mostly a measurement of upward conspiracy beliefs, and emphasises the relevance of distinguishing conspiracy theories based on the types of groups they target.","tags":["RWA","Romania","conspiracy theories","Roma"],"date":"2023-02-21T08:22:46.560263","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/f7wkj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/f7wkj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/f7wkj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/f7wkj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_861"}

AI algorithms are informed by expert knowledge, can process multiple data points quickly, and perform many automatic tasks. As such, they can complement the therapy provided by trained professionals and relieve much of the administrative burden healthcare workers experience. In this paper we offer a model for using AI in the daily practice of mental health providers. We discuss ways for clinicians to utilize the data and the services provided by AI to augment therapists\u2019 decision making and maintain the interpersonal connection, while delegating other functions to automated services. We review how AI can augment and scale therapy in many parts of the clinician\u2019s work, from initial screening and routine measurement-based care to digitally-enabled and blended interventions, as well as operational services. We review evidence related to responsible implementation of AI in clinical practice and suggest future research directions and implementation strategies for AI-augmentation.","tags":["Clinical Practice","Artificial intelligence","Mental Healthcare","Training","AI-Augmentation","Real-world treatment","Clinical Decision Support Systems"],"date":"2023-02-21T09:48:57.056827","doi":null,"subjects":["Therapy","Psychotherapy","Clinical Decision Making","Intervention Research","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/z56yq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/z56yq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/z56yq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/z56yq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_863"}

It may be that when children start to understand counting, they also discover the structure of the number system. At this stage they may understand that the cardinality of a set is the last number assigned after counting each item (cardinal principle) and that each number represents the cardinality of the set created by adding one to an empty set for every count it takes to reach that number (successor function). We tested this by assessing children\u2019s early understanding of the successor function in relation to their cardinality knowledge. Children who were not yet cardinal principle knowers demonstrated understanding of the successor function within the limits of their cardinality knowledge. Our findings suggest that children have some structural knowledge of the number system before learning how counting tracks cardinality. We discuss how continued counting practice may eventually allow children to expand this knowledge across all numbers.","tags":["conceptual development","numerical cognition","mathematics","number","counting","cardinality"],"date":"2023-02-21T13:41:28.744457","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology","Cognitive Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5aytf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5aytf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5aytf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5aytf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_864"}

However, evidence for this claim is questionable. Previous findings have shown that paternal involvement is linked to testosterone, but have not investigated facial masculinity directly, while other studies have found that facial masculinity is negatively associated with perceptions of paternal involvement but do not assess the accuracy of this judgement. Here, we assess whether facial masculinity in men is used as a cue to paternal involvement, and whether this cue is accurate. We collected facial photographs of 259 men (156 of which were fathers) who also completed self-report measures of paternal involvement. Facial images were then rated by a separate group of raters on facial masculinity, attractiveness, and perceived paternal involvement. Shape sexual dimorphism was also calculated from the images using geometric morphometrics. We found that facial masculinity was not associated with perceptions of paternal involvement, nor was it related with self-reported paternal involvement. Interestingly, facial attractiveness was negatively associated with perceptions of paternal involvement, and we found partial evidence that facial attractiveness was also negatively associated with self-reported paternal involvement. These findings challenge the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism is used as a cue to paternal involvement, and perhaps indicate that facial attractiveness is more important for this judgement instead.","tags":["parental effort","face perception","paternal investment","sexual dimorphism","mate preference","attraction"],"date":"2023-02-21T13:45:57.364338","doi":"10.1007\/s40750-023-00217-y","subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Impression Formation","Mating","Parenting","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7pj8w\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7pj8w\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7pj8w","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7pj8w","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s40750-023-00217-y","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_866"}

Within categories, the objects are distributed, meaning that in each category the object features may vary and correlate, and processing this distribution can improve categorizations. Whether people use the within-category feature distribution information to categorize objects is unclear due to mixed evidence. To investigate the role of within-category feature distributions in categorization, we designed two experiments, manipulating the variances and correlations of features within categories through simulation-based optimal experimental design. Using computational cognitive modeling in an exemplar-similarity framework, we compared a psychological process that ignores the within-category feature distributions (Euclidean similarity) to a process that considers the within-category feature distributions (Mahalanobis similarity). The experiments (both Ns = 43) clearly showed that most participants did not consider the within-category feature distributions, and their behavior is best described by the simpler Euclidean similarity. Nevertheless, a minority of participants were described by the Mahalanobis similarity, which considers the within-category feature distributions, even though their categorizations were less evident than those of the participants described by the Euclidean similarity. In sum, the results suggest that in categorization the psychological processing of similarities between objects is mostly invariant to the distribution from which the objects stem, which may be because it\nis computationally more costly to estimate the distribution of features in categories.","tags":["Within-category representation","Knowledge representation","Similarity","Categorization","Category variability effect"],"date":"2023-02-21T14:21:32.540583","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Concepts and Categories"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7v95h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7v95h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7v95h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7v95h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_868"}

To date, some universities still require staff and students to work from home or are using a hybrid approach. Research investigating the impact of online teaching on academics is needed. The current study examined whether online teaching was associated with work-related stress, burnout, wellbeing, and job satisfaction among higher education teaching staff. The buffering effects of social support and compassion satisfaction were also investigated. An online questionnaire was completed by 95 academic staff members from UK higher education institutions. Parallel mediation analyses showed that work-related stress while teaching online was related to poorer wellbeing, lower levels of job satisfaction, and increased burnout. Staff who reported higher levels of work-based social support and higher levels of compassion satisfaction also reported higher wellbeing and job satisfaction, and lower levels of work-related stress and burnout. Further, compassion satisfaction mediated the link between work-based stress, well-being, job satisfaction and burnout. Universities must acknowledge the ongoing and long-term impact of online teaching on academic staff. There is a need to consider ways to reduce work-related stress and increase compassion satisfaction among higher education academics to improve psychological wellbeing.","tags":["covid-19","stress","higher education","teachers","burnout","wellbeing","compassion satisfaction"],"date":"2023-02-21T15:04:41.120273","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/juw35\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/juw35\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/juw35","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/juw35","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_869"}

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework of knowledge assessment that explains how people construct mental models of their own knowledge and the knowledge of others. Our framework posits that people integrate information about their own and others' knowledge via Bayesian inference. To evaluate this claim, we conduct an experiment in which participants repeatedly assess their own performance (a metacognitive task) and the performance of another person (a type of theory of mind task) on the same image classification tasks. We contrast the hierarchical framework with simpler alternatives that assume different degrees of differentiation between mental models of self and others. Our model accurately captures participants' assessment of their own performance and the performance of others in the task: initially, people rely on their own self-assessment process to reason about the other person's performance, leading to similar self- and other-performance predictions. As more information about the other person's  ability becomes available, the  mental model for the other person becomes increasingly distinct from the mental model of self.  Simulation studies also confirm that our framework explains a wide range of findings about human knowledge assessment of themselves and others.","tags":["Other Assessment","Metacognition","Mental Models","Theory of Mind","Bayesian Modeling","Mindreading"],"date":"2023-02-21T15:14:57.304931","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Reasoning","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/jvkp5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/jvkp5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/jvkp5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/jvkp5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_870"}

{"osf_id":"vwnec","title":"Study Dropout Thoughts in Male University Students as Warning Sign for Suicidal Ideation and Mental Health Problems","description":"Background: Increasing prevalence rates for suicidal ideation among university students call for better understanding of critical risk factors. Because of traditional masculinity ideologies (TMI; socially defined sets of standards and norms how men are expected to be or behave), men are less likely to report suicidal ideation but up to four times more likely to die by suicide. Establishing low-threshold risk factors to identify suicidal ideation among male students at an early stage is paramount. Study dropout thoughts, due to a particular relationship with TMI, could be one such risk factor. The present study therefore examines the relationship between study dropout thoughts and suicidal ideation as well as gender-differences in risk patterns. Methods: A total of N = 4894 German university students (24.6% men) completed a cross-sectional online survey on mental health at the University of Cologne. A first part of the survey consisted of sociodemographic and study related questions (e.g., study dropout thoughts). In the second part psychological syndromes (any psychological syndrome, depressive syndrome, alcohol syndrome), life stressors and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire D (PHQ-D). \nResults: Male university students expressed study dropout thoughts more frequently than female students, while for both genders study dropout thoughts were associated with increased suicidal ideation. Significant gender-differences were observed for all outcomes, with financial stress and a recent bad experience being risk factors for suicidal ideation in men but not women. Relationship problems, problems at work, and current psychotherapy use were associated with increased suicidal ideation in women but not in men. \nConclusions: In the University context, study dropout thoughts are expressed often, especially by male students. Given that study dropout thoughts are associated with suicidal ideation and that male-specific risk patterns for suicidal ideation have been identified, men who report thoughts of dropping out of studies or experience financial stress should be screened for suicidality and mental health problems. Future prevention measures in the University context should consider study dropout thoughts and male-specific risk-patterns to increase chances for detection of male students at risk for suicide and to improve the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs specifically targeting men.","tags":["Study dropout thoughts","Suicide","Suicidal ideation","Gender differences","Students"],"date":"2023-02-21T16:44:11.899067","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vwnec\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vwnec\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vwnec","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vwnec","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_872"}
{"osf_id":"bgk2f","title":"Psychological Barriers Moderate the Attitude-Behavior Gap for Climate Change","description":"Behavioral change has been increasingly recognized as a means for combating climate change. However, being concerned about climate problems and knowing the importance of individual actions in mitigating them is not enough for greater adherence to a more sustainable lifestyle. Psychological barriers such as (1) finding the change unnecessary; (2) conflicting goals; (3) social influences; (4) lack of knowledge; and (5) tokenism have been proposed as an explanation for the gap between environmental attitudes and actions. Yet, so far, this hypothesis has remained untested. This study aimed to assess if psychological barriers moderate the association between environmental attitudes and climate action. A sample of Portuguese individuals (N = 937) responded to a survey measuring climate change beliefs and environmental concerns as an index of environmental attitudes, a scale of self-reported frequency of environmental action, and finally, the dragons of inaction psychological barrier scale. Our participants revealed generally elevated positive environmental attitudes. These attitudes were positively and moderately related to greater self-reported frequency of environmental action in areas such as reusing materials, reduced consumption of animal products, water and energy saving, and airplane use, but not driving less. Critically, the association between attitudes and behavior was negatively moderated by psychological barriers for the reuse, food, and saving domains, but not for driving or flying. In conclusion, our results corroborate the assumption that psychological barriers can partly explain the attitude-behavior gap in the climate action domain.","tags":["psychological barriers","attitude-behavior gap","pro-environmental behavior","climate change","environmental psychology"],"date":"2023-02-21T17:30:03.123207","doi":null,"subjects":["Sustainability Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Environmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bgk2f\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bgk2f\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bgk2f","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bgk2f","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_873"}

On each trial, participants were either presented with a colored square or tasked with using mental imagery to generate a colored square that could match the target (valid trial) or distractor (invalid trial) in the search array that followed (Experiments 1 and 3). In a separate experiment, the colored square displayed or generated was replaced with a realistic object in a specific category that could appear as a target or distractor in the search array (Experiment 2). Although the displayed object was in the same category as an item in the search display, they were never a perfect match (e.g., jam drop cookie instead of chocolate chip). Our findings revealed that the facilitation of performance on valid trials compared to invalid trials was greater for perceptual cues than imagery cues for low-level features (Experiment 1), whereas the influence of these two types of cues was comparable in the context of realistic objects (Experiment 2) The influence of mental imagery appears not to extend to the resolution of conflict generated by color-word Stroop stimuli.

Here we examine and operationalize the choice to lie using a mathematical model which we fit to participant behavior. This model combines perceptions of exploitability and fairness attitudes to explore the interaction between two types of utility: instrumental utility and moral utility. These utilities differed in concert with individual differences in participants\u2019 behavioral traits, and those differences underwrote lies with distinct motivations. Strategic deception \u2013 wherein the lie benefits the individual - was common amongst people with elevated subclinical psychopathic traits in the absence of paranoia. It was driven by differences in instrumental utility. Whereas pathological deception \u2013 which has no apparent economic or strategic benefit \u2013 was common among highly paranoid participants (who also had elevated scores on dark triad personality traits)  and was governed by the moral utility of the lie. They lied for little apparent benefit because they failed to modulate their fairness attitudes in line with the decision context.  These data challenge accounts of deception that suggest deceiving oneself is a prerequisite to successful lying. They also oppose accounts of psychopathology that connect psychopathic traits to pathological lying, and theories that implicate strategic social decision-making dysfunction in paranoia. More broadly, these data highlight the importance of individual differences in efforts to mitigate deception, which have thus far, largely focused on incentive structures and decision architectures.","tags":["Computational Model","Psychopathy","Individual Differences","Paranoia","Deception"],"date":"2023-02-21T20:15:52.380008","doi":null,"subjects":["Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Psychology","Mental Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/z48qm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/z48qm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/z48qm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/z48qm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_875"}

Across four preregistered studies, we examined the development of \u201cgroup-transcendent fairness\u201d, i.e. the moral endorsement of allocating resources equally to ingroup members and outgroup members. We found that when allocating common resources to ingroup and outgroup members, American adults (N = 549) thought it was morally right to allocate equally instead of giving more to their family, political, or minimal ingroup members, across high and low stakes (Study 1). This normative sense of group-transcendent fairness develops gradually: 4-6-year-olds tended to endorse ingroup favoritism, whereas by age 8 or 9 children endorsed intergroup fairness (Studies 2-3, N = 214). Adults from China (N = 200) \u2013\u2013 a culture that values ingroup loyalty \u2013\u2013 also endorsed intergroup fairness as morally right, suggesting this moral value is not specific to western societies where egalitarianism is emphasized (Study 4). In contrast to the normative endorsement of intergroup fairness, participants in all studies did not predict most people to be fair across contexts, suggesting group-transcendent fairness was perceived more as a prescriptive than a descriptive norm (Studies 1-4). Together, our studies reveal the robust presence of group-transcendent fairness, which is valued across group contexts and cultures, develops later than ingroup support, and is prescriptive but not descriptive by nature. The findings help illuminate the nature and development of one group-transcendent moral value that helps promote intergroup relations and societal progress.","tags":["fairness; group-transcendence; ingroup support; moral development; normal perception","intergroup relations"],"date":"2023-02-22T00:16:58.514240","doi":null,"subjects":["Developmental Psychology","Middle & Late Childhood","Moral Development","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Early Childhood"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j63vf\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j63vf\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j63vf","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j63vf","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_876"}

{"osf_id":"xyzw2","title":"Optimal computation regarding risk attitudes in motor decision-making under risk","description":"The process of motor planning involves considering the movement variability and value of the motor outcome. Previous studies have shown that individuals tend to exhibit a consistent risk-seeking bias when performing a temporal aiming task, which involves aiming to respond as closely as possible to a reference time without any delay. However, it is unclear whether this bias is caused by a subjective attempt to take risks or by overestimating motor accuracy. Here, we examined changes in participants\u2019 aiming points after they were instructed regarding subjective risk-attitudes. The results from four different task settings in Experiments 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c, consistently showed a good correspondence between participants\u2019 objective and subjective risk-attitudes. However, in a free-choice situation where participants were instructed to maximize their scores, a robust risk-seeking bias was identified.

Grieve et al. (2022) tested the effects of an intervention designed to reduce perfectionism. Contrary to their hypotheses, the intervention reduced both perfectionism and excellencism. Furthermore, excellencism positively correlated with negative outcomes (e.g., anxiety). Aims. A theory-driven framework (with five hypothetical scenarios) is proposed to reconsider how we interpret the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce perfectionism. Our goal was to offer a constructive reinterpretation of the results of Grieve et al. (2022) using our new framework derived from the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism. Methods. Secondary data analyses using the experimental and correlational results published in the randomized control trial of Grieve et al. (2022). Results. Our reexamination of the results reveals that excellencism was reduced by a smaller extent (approximately 25% less) than perfectionism. Based on our framework, such a ratio provides conclusive evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention. Students entered the intervention as perfectionists and they ended up somewhere between the zones of excellence striving and non-perfectionism. Furthermore, our multivariate reanalysis of the bivariate correlations indicates that excellence strivers experienced better adjustment (lower anxiety, depression, stress, body-related acceptance, and higher self-compassion) compared to perfectionists. Conclusion. Future interventions should target the reduction of perfectionism while minimizing iatrogenic effects on excellencism because excellencism relates to desirable outcomes. Our secondary data analysis was needed to urgently inform researchers and practitioners about an alternative interpretation of Grieve and colleagues\u2019 findings. Future interventions to reduce perfectionism should closely monitor excellencism and follow the interpretational guidelines advanced in this article.","tags":["mental health","excellencism","depression","self-compassion","stress","anxiety","RCT","eating disorders","cognitive behavioral therapy","perfectionism"],"date":"2023-02-22T05:39:25.464934","doi":null,"subjects":["Interventions","Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/q2fea\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/q2fea\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/q2fea","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/q2fea","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_880"}

An obstacle is the heterogeneity of developmental pathways causing clinical phenotypes. Additionally, in symptom formations, the primary causes and consequences of developmental learning processes are often indistinguishable. Herein, we review developmental neurorobotic experiments tackling problems related to the dynamic and complex properties of neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, we focus on neurorobotic models under predictive processing lens for the study of developmental disorders. By constructing neurorobotic models with predictive processing mechanisms of learning, perception, and action, we can simulate formations of integrated causal relationships among neurodynamical, computational, and behavioral characteristics in the robot agents while considering developmental learning processes. This framework has the potential to bind neurobiological hypotheses (excitation-inhibition imbalance and functional disconnection), computational accounts (unusual encoding of uncertainty), and clinical symptoms. Developmental neurorobotic approaches may serve as a complementary research framework for integrating fragmented knowledge and overcoming the heterogeneity of neurodevelopmental disorders.","tags":["predictive processing theory","neurodevelopmental disorder","computational psychiatry","Cognitive neurorobotics","digital twin"],"date":"2023-02-22T07:16:36.325555","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Systems Neuroscience","Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6wfd7\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6wfd7\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6wfd7","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6wfd7","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_882"}

Although recent research has begun examining the construct more widely, there exist several gaps in scholarship. One such area is the influence, association, and role of affective factors in determining whether and to what extent an entity engages in dark creativity. After introducing concepts like negative and malevolent creativity, this chapter reviews the existing literature on the link between affective factors and creativity. Thereafter, the features of dark personality traits, like psychopathy, are examined with reference to affective considerations such as low empathy in producing original harm. Owing to the relationship between dark creativity and moral concerns, we also examine how moral emotions like guilt and shame (or lack thereof) may contribute to an understanding of such creativity.

In three experiments, we tested this prediction by asking participants to read\/listen to naturalistic stories before their memory was tested after a 12-hr interval, which included either daytime wakefulness or overnight sleep. To assess discourse memory, we used sentence recognition (Experiment 1; N = 386), free story recall (Experiment 2; N = 96), and cued recall (Experiments 2 and 3; N = 192). We found no evidence of sleep-related effects in sentence recognition or free recall, but cued recall (aka fill-in-the-blank) showed that the degree of time-dependent distortion, as indexed by both a subjective categorisation measure and Latent Semantic Analysis, was lower after sleep than after wake. Our experiments suggest that the effect of sleep on discourse memory may [1] be constrained by the retrieval processes (recollection vs. familiarity &amp; associative vs. item), [2] lie on a qualitative level that is difficult to detect in an all-or-nothing scoring metric, and [3] primarily situate in the textbase level of the tripartite model of discourse processing.

To address this gap, we asked adults with dyslexia and matched controls to perform an interval comparison task involving five different types of visual stimuli with different levels of challenge regarding luminance contrasts and motion. Results showed poorer time discrimination in adults with dyslexia, but this group-related disadvantage did not change according to stimulus type. Complementary analyses of oculomotor behavior during the task suggested that the poorer timing performance of dyslexics may relate to attention and\/or engagement with the task.

{"osf_id":"6mzxd","title":"Unweaving the web: Polygenic influences on networks of psychopathology symptoms","description":"Objective: Polygenic risk score (PRS) studies commonly employ a disorder-level approach to phenotyping, implicitly considering psychiatric disorders as homogenous constructs. However, symptom heterogeneity is ubiquitous, with many possible combinations of symptoms falling under the same disorder umbrella. Focusing on individual symptoms can shed a new light on the role of genetics in the aetiology of psychopathology and comorbidity, by establishing (i) whether PRS associate with all symptoms of psychiatric disorders, or with a subset of core indicators; (ii) whether PRS associate with comorbid phenotypes via specific sets of relevant symptoms.\nMethods: Networks of symptoms and PRS were estimated in a sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), including PRS for depression, anxiety, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), body mass index (BMI) and educational attainment. Following pre-registered analyses, models were cross-validated in an independent sample from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS).\nResults: Findings first indicate that PRS do not uniformly associate with all symptoms within psychopathology measures and instead associate primarily with restricted subsets. This suggests that polygenic risk may primarily influence core psychopathology symptoms and indirectly propagate to others. Second, psychiatric PRS associate with specific cross-disorder symptoms, while non-psychiatric PRS associate with a variety of indicators across disorders, suggesting a potential contribution of non-psychiatric traits to comorbidity. Patterns of associations also suggest pathways linking polygenic risk to psychopathology in childhood.\nConclusions: Genetic associations observed at the disorder level may hide symptom-level heterogeneity. A symptom-level approach enables a better understanding of the role of polygenic risk in shaping  psychopathology and comorbidity.","tags":["network analysis","childhood","phenotyping","ADHD","depression","TEDS","anxiety","ALSPAC","psychopathology","comorbidity","polygenic scores"],"date":"2023-02-22T12:33:47.075777","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Psychiatry","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Developmental Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6mzxd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6mzxd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6mzxd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6mzxd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_886"}

Little is known about who can discontinue safely and whether discontinuation symptoms constitute a risk factor for relapse. This study investigated risk factors for experiencing discontinuation symptoms and whether discontinuation symptoms are associated with depression relapse.\nMethods: 103 patients with a currently remitted major depressive disorder were randomized to continuation or discontinuation of antidepressants. Discontinuation symptoms were assessed with the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) scale. The discontinuation syndrome (ADS) was defined as experiencing at least 4 DESS symptoms. We investigated the association of clinical factors with the number of discontinuation symptoms in Bayesian linear regressions. After the randomization phase, all patients discontinued their antidepressant and were followed up over 6 months. We investigated the association of discontinuation symptoms and clinical factors with relapse risk in logistic regressions and a cox proportional hazards model. \nResults: An ADS was experienced by 29% (95% PI [8.3%, 72%]) of patients. Women reported more discontinuation symptoms than men (factor 1.67 (95% interval [1.06, 2.56])). None of the other prespecified predictors were associated with the risk or severity of ADS. Trait anxiety (Slope = 0.42, 95% PI [-0.01, 0.90]), ADS severity (0.58, 95% PI [0.07, 1.16]) and early depressive symptoms (0.63, 95% PI [0.16, 1.17]) were associated with a higher relapse risk. \nConclusion: Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were relatively common and experienced mainly by women.

Standardization of the MCPS scale","description":"Creative problem-solving is associated with the resolution of ill-defined tasks where the goals, procedure, and evaluation criteria are not predetermined. Successful problem solvers have to set their own unique goals, develop appropriate strategies, plan individual steps, generate various possible solutions, monitor and regulate the problem-solving process, and evaluate the outcome for novelty and usefulness. The present study aims to standardize the Metacognition in Creative Problem-Solving (MCPS) scale, which captures metacognitive skills (planning, monitoring, regulation, and evaluation) in creative problem-solving. The 11-item instrument was adapted from the widely recognized Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The representative sample of 350 university students was employed in the exploratory phase, and 110 working professionals were employed in the confirmatory phase. Both the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the item response theory (IRT) examination yielded an excellent reliability of the MCPS scale (\u03c9 = .91, and marginal reliability = .92). Moreover, the MCPS scale was correlated with creative performance (r = .26) and absolute accuracy of on-task metacognitive monitoring (r = -.19). The relationship between the MCPS scale and creative performance was stable, even after the controlling for the original MSLQ, suggesting that the MCPS scale is both a reliable and valid instrument that measures metacognition in creative problem-solving in both educational and professional environments.","tags":["item response theory","questionnaire standardization","creative problem-solving","metacognition"],"date":"2023-02-22T14:46:21.062560","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Educational Psychology","Problem Solving"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5y83h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5y83h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5y83h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5y83h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_891"}

The current study is the first longitudinal examination of the relationship between attenuated positive symptoms and suicidal ideation among individuals at CHR-P. Thirty-six participants were recruited from an early psychosis intervention center. Attenuated positive symptoms and the presence of suicidal ideation were assessed at each session. Logistic mixed effect models were used to examine the concurrent and time-lagged relationship between suicidal ideation and total attenuated symptoms as well as specific attenuated symptoms (unusual thought content, suspiciousness, grandiose ideas, perceptual abnormalities, and disorganized communication). Results indicated that greater total attenuated symptoms were associated with the presence of suicidal ideation. Further investigation into specific symptoms showed significant associations between suicidal ideation and suspiciousness in both the concurrent and the time-lagged models. Post hoc bidirectional models (i.e. suicidal ideation predicting time lagged attenuated symptoms) were also used to shed light on issues of causality and directionality. Results supported a bidirectional relationship between suspiciousness and suicidal ideation, raising questions about the causal nature of this relationship.

{"osf_id":"46xfh","title":"The frequency of mind wandering increases over time during ongoing task performance","description":"Attention has a seemingly inevitable tendency to turn inward towards our thoughts. Mind wandering refers to moments when this inward focus diverts attention away from the task-at-hand. Mind wandering is ubiquitous, having been estimated to occur between 30-50% of our waking moments and proposed to increase in frequency with time during ongoing task performance. Yet, it is unclear whether mind wandering systematically increases with time-on-task for a broad range of tasks, or if there is heterogeneity in the magnitude of within-task change in mind wandering. We conducted a systematic literature search and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of rates of occurrence of mind wandering during task performance. Our search located 57 research articles providing roughly 400,000 total responses to experience sampling mind wandering probes from more than 10,000 unique individuals. Latent growth curve models estimated the initial occurrence of mind wandering and linear change in mind wandering over sequential probes for each study sample, and effects were summarized using multivariate meta-analysis. Our results confirm that mind wandering increases in frequency over time during task performance, implicating mind wandering in characteristic patterns of worsening behavioral performance with time-on-task known as the vigilance decrement. The systematic search and meta-analysis further provide the most comprehensive assessment of normative rates of mind wandering during task performance reported to date.","tags":["IPD meta-analysis","thought sampling","sustained attention","vigilance","mind wandering"],"date":"2023-02-22T17:07:01.565310","doi":null,"subjects":["Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/46xfh\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/46xfh\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/46xfh","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/46xfh","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_895"}
{"osf_id":"nd653","title":"A computational approach to studying aesthetic judgments of ambiguous artworks","description":"Visual ambiguity plays a key role in the perceptual experience of art and has been much exploited by modernist and contemporary artists for aesthetic effects. But it remains unclear how aesthetic judgments are affected by visual ambiguity, and the subjective nature of aesthetic experience makes it difficult to measure. Wang et al. (2020) piloted a methodology in which a large collection of free-form textual descriptions of artworks were gathered from participants. The variability of these descriptions was then quantified computationally with Shannon entropy; ambiguous images tended to generate a greater number and wider diversity of descriptive terms. In the present study, we evaluated how well these measures can predict aesthetic preference for ambiguous images. We designed three crowdsourcing tasks in order to measure aesthetic preferences. The first was a simple rating task, and the other two required the participants to engage more actively with the images. We hypothesized that the number of associations evoked by ambiguous works of art, when computationally measured by entropy and description lengths, is a factor in judgments of their aesthetic value. Following this hypothesis, we made and tested a number of predictions. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis, but with some interesting caveats and exceptions. We find that the form of the task significantly affects preference ratings and that participants\u2019 responses can be clustered into two categories: those that prefer simple, recognizable imagery, and those that prefer more complex, ambiguous imagery. When taking this clustering into account, we find that our measures of entropy are correlated with aesthetic ratings. We conclude that these computational methods are useful for investigating the variable subjective responses to ambiguous artworks.","tags":["Indeterminacy","Ambiguity","Aesthetic judgement","Artwork perception"],"date":"2023-02-22T21:20:48.997572","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Vision","Engineering Psychology","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/nd653\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/nd653\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/nd653","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/nd653","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_896"}

However, the direction of their relationship is unclear\u2014does social interaction shape loneliness, or does loneliness shape willingness to interact? We explored dynamics of these social experiences under exceptional circumstances: COVID-19 lockdowns, which were necessary for public health but impacted people\u2019s social lives. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between social interaction and loneliness in and out of lockdown in Australia. We used experience sampling methodology to follow 233 people across one week (Mage=30; 8,495 surveys) in a period that spanned one of the longest lockdowns in the world. While loneliness did not predict subsequent social interaction, having a social interaction predicted lower subsequent loneliness, particularly in (vs. out of) lockdown. These findings suggest social interactions may limit loneliness, especially during physical isolation. In short, times when we are apart from others may be times we benefit from interacting with them most.","tags":["covid-19","lockdown","loneliness","experience sampling","social interaction"],"date":"2023-02-23T01:38:34.763303","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Well-being"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/eavfd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/eavfd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/eavfd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/eavfd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_897"}
{"osf_id":"rbd2x","title":"The Response Process Evaluation Method","description":"Pretesting survey items for interpretability and relevance is a commonly recommended practice in the social sciences. The goal is to construct items that are understood as intended by the population of interest and test if participants use the expected cognitive processes when responding to a survey item. Such evidence forms the basis for a critical source of validity evidence known as the response process, which is often neglected in favor of quantitative methods. This may be because existing methods of investigating item comprehension, such as cognitive interviewing and web probing, lack clear guidelines for retesting revised items and documenting improvements, and can be difficult to implement in large samples. To remedy this, we introduce the Response Process Evaluation (RPE) method. The RPE method is a standardized framework for pretesting multiple versions of survey items and generating individual item validation reports. This iterative, evidence-based approach to item development relies on feedback from the population of interest to quantify and qualify improvements in item interpretability across a large sample. The result is a set of item validation reports that detail the intended interpretation and use of each item, the population it was validated on, the percent of participants that interpreted the item as intended, examples of participant interpretations, and any common misinterpretations to be cautious of. Researchers may find that they have more confidence in the inferences drawn from survey data after engaging in rigorous item pretesting.","tags":["web probing","response process","survey instrument","psychometrics","qualitative research","cognitive interviewing","patient reported outcome measures","pretesting","construct mapping","validity"],"date":"2023-02-23T05:40:51.803882","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rbd2x\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rbd2x\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rbd2x","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rbd2x","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_898"}

Results revealed that (1) infants increased their pointing frequency across age, but high-SES infants had a steeper increase, and a higher pointing frequency than low-SES infants from 10 months onward, (2) maternal pointing frequency was not associated with infant pointing frequency at any age, (3) infants\u2019 point following abilities to targets behind their visual fields was positively associated with infant pointing at 12 months, after pointing had already emerged around 10 months. Findings suggest that family SES impacts infants\u2019 pointing development more generally, not just through maternal pointing.

But the presence of common background noise levels such as those found in cafes and restaurants can be a barrier to conversational success. Here, we used speech and motion-tracking to reveal the behavioral processes that talkers use to communicate effectively during conversations in noisy environments. Natural speech communication of twenty-two pairs of normal- hearing adults was elicited under different conditions of realistic background noise, while standing freely or sitting around a table. The results revealed how the behavior of conversing partners entail three phases of adaptive behavior. First, with the onset of background noise, pairs rapidly adjusted their interpersonal distance and speech level, with the degree of initial change dependent on noise level and talker configuration. Following this transient phase of behavioral adaptation, pairs settled into a steady- state or sustaining phase of behavioral coordination, in which reciprocal speech and movement-based coordination processes operated to synergistically maintain effective communication, again with the magnitude of stability of these coordination processes covarying with noise level and talker configuration. Finally, as communication breakdowns started to increase at high levels of background noise, pairs exhibited intermittent resetting behaviors to help restore communication. That is, individuals further decreased interpersonal distance and\/or increased speech levels in direct response to communication breakdowns. The findings show that approximately 78 dB SPL defines a critical noise threshold where behavioral coordination processes are no longer sufficient for maintaining effective conversation and communication breakdowns rapidly increase.","tags":["repair requests","interpersonal motor coordination","communication breakdown","background noise","interactive communication"],"date":"2023-02-23T09:59:42.372189","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Linguistics","Perception","Quantitative Methods","Psychology, other","Interpersonal Relationships","Audition","Nonverbal Behavior","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/e76hw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/e76hw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/e76hw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/e76hw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_900"}

Visual processing enhancement in PPS occurs also when perceived depth is based on 2D pictorial cues. This advantage has been observed from relatively low-level (detection, size, orientation) to high-level visual features (face processing) (Ahsan et al., 2021; Dureux et al., 2021). While multisensory association also displays proximal advantages (Zanini et al., 2021), whether PPS influences visual perceptual learning remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether perceptual learning effects vary according to the distance of visual stimuli (near or far) from the observer, illusorily induced by leveraging the Ponzo illusion. Participants performed a visual search task in which they reported whether a specific target object orientation (e.g., triangle pointing downward) was present among distractors. Performance was assessed before and after practicing the visual search task (30 minutes\/day for 5 days) at either the close (near group) or far distance (far group). Results showed that participants that performed the training in the near space did not improve. By contrast, participants that performed the training in the far space showed an improvement in the visual search task in both the far and near spaces. We suggest that such improvement in the far training is due to a greater deployment of attention in the far space, which could make the learning more effective and generalize across spaces.","tags":["extrapersonal space","peripersonal space","visual learning","perceptual learning"],"date":"2023-02-23T10:41:07.606528","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/4en3m\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/4en3m\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4en3m","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4en3m","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_901"}

Loot boxes are viewed by many as gambling-like and are prevalently implemented globally. Previous Western and international studies have consistently found loot box spending to be positively correlated with problem gambling. Previous Western studies presented mixed results as to the correlations between loot box purchasing and gambling-related risk factors, mental wellbeing, and psychological distress. A large-scale survey of adult video game players from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (N = 2,601) was conducted through Tencent Survey. The positive correlations between loot box spending and problem gambling, and between loot box spending and problem videogaming, were successfully replicated. However, other potential risk factors (i.e., impulsivity\/impulsiveness; binary past-year gambling participation status; and sensation-seeking tendencies) either did not positively correlate with loot box spending or only did so weakly. Contrary to expectations, high impulsivity was negatively associated with loot box engagement. The Risky Loot Box Index (RLI) most strongly positively correlated with, and was the best predictor in multiple linear regression models for, loot box spending. The RLI may be effective at measuring loot box harms cross-culturally. A surprising weak positive correlation was found between loot box engagement and PRC players\u2019 mental wellbeing, and high psychological distress unexpectedly negatively predicted loot box purchasing. Although gambling-like, the risk and protective factors of loot boxes are seemingly different, meaning they should rightfully be treated as novel products.

In this task, participants retrieve or suppress memories in response to an associated reminder cue. After each suppression trial, participants rate whether the association had intruded into awareness. Using linear modelling, previous research has found that repeatedly exerting intentional control over memory intrusions reduces their frequency. This paper discusses the differences in methodology and analytical approaches used by studies in the past 10 years investigating intrusion control via the T\/NT paradigm. In addition, by reanalysing published datasets, we demonstrate large individual variability within studies in the number of intrusions reported within each block of the T\/NT task. Results revealed that the change in intrusion frequencies across time is not linear, but quadratic. We propose the Index of Intrusion Control (IIC) to measure the change in intrusion frequencies across time. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this metric has superior predictive value for subsequent forgetting effects, when compared to approaches used in previous studies. We conclude with recommendations for improving the validity of the design and results of future studies and streamlining methodology and analyses between studies investigating intrusion control in the laboratory.","tags":["Intrusions","Think\/No-Think","Index of Intrusion Control (IIC)","Forgetting","Intentional Memory Control"],"date":"2023-02-23T11:30:54.135185","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3vc8q\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3vc8q\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3vc8q","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3vc8q","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_903"}

Repeated exposure to such memories may help breaking avoidance and promote the habituation of disgust, thereby lowering body concerns. Using a within-participant experimental design, we tested if repeatedly exposing women with high self-disgust (N = 61) to disgust-focused body-related memories vs. neutral memories led to changes in disgust, body acceptance, and reactive avoidance. Disgust towards the body itself only decreased following neutral exposure. Disgust elicited by the body-related memories also decreased following repeated disgust exposure trials. In the disgust exposure session, stronger habitual prevention of body-related disgust was associated with higher disgust elicited by the memories, whereas reactive avoidance increased from pre to post exposure. Pre-post decreases in state disgust in the disgust exposure session were associated with increases in acceptance. Results regarding the disgust exposure session point to the potency of repeated exposure to disgust-eliciting memories as a means to promote the habituation of disgust and formation of positive body appraisals. The tenacity of disgust-driven avoidance highlights the importance of effective response prevention.","tags":["autobiographical memory","disgust avoidance","body image","repeated exposure","self-disgust"],"date":"2023-02-23T12:36:11.554980","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Feeding and Eating Disorders","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/3g9uy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/3g9uy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3g9uy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3g9uy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_904"}

Thus, the development of efficient strategies to increase the public's awareness of climate change is essential. Previous research has shown that one such strategy, consensus messaging, can correct peoples' misconceptions about their estimation of scientific consensus concerning climate change and increase, for example, their support for measures against global warming. Given the importance\nof developing reliable strategies, understanding the circumstances under which consensus messaging does and does not work is crucial. Thus, the present study investigated confidence in perceived scientific consensus (PSC) as a moderator variable in the consensus messaging process, using a national representative US sample (N = 898). More specifically, we investigated the role of confidence in PSC for (i) the debiasing process, i.e., the integration of the consensus message into the\nestimation of scientific consensus, and (ii) the updating process of climate change attitudes (belief in climate change, worry about climate change, and human causation of climate change). Results showed that confidence in PSC significantly predicts how much participants updated their PSC toward the consensus. We replicated those results for a high-consensus country (N = 1110,\nrepresentative German sample). Furthermore, confidence in PSC played a moderating role in updating participants\u2019 beliefs in the human causation of climate change. Our findings suggest climate change related metacognition to be an important factor explaining the formation and updating of corresponding beliefs and highlight the importance of considering metacognitive aspects of climate\nchange communication strategies.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-23T13:40:52.429264","doi":null,"subjects":["Life Sciences","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bwksd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bwksd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bwksd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bwksd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_905"}

Common sequalae of ABI, such as poor attention and memory, can create barriers to the efficacy of cognitively demanding mood interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Behavioural Activation (BA), where individuals plan and engage in reinforcing activities, is a promising alternative due to lower cognitive demands. However, BA was initially developed in clinical populations without ABI where the primary barriers to activity engagement were low mood and anxious avoidance. Additionally, BA can incorporate a range of techniques (e.g., mood monitoring, activity scheduling, targeting avoidance, contingency management) and psychoeducational topics (e.g., mindfulness, managing uncertainty; social\/communication skills). Exploring barriers and facilitators to adopting specific BA components in ABI is an important aim.\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected ABI survivors (N = 16) with both low and high depressive symptoms, and family members (N = 7). Questions focused on routine and enjoyable activities, and feedback on 10 different BA techniques and associated psychoeducational topics. Transcripts were analysed using an interpretive description framework. Analysis was informed by field notes, reflexivity diaries, and peer debriefing.\nResults: The final constructed framework, Creating Sustainable Engagement, comprises a two-tier hierarchy. Higher-level themes concerned core perspectives of BA, regardless of BA component discussed. This included identifying optimal time windows for different BA components (Right Tool at the Right Time), that BA components should, at least initially, not be burdensome or fatiguing (Perceived Effort), that emotional readiness to confront activity-mood relationships should be addressed (Emotional Impact), and that planned BA activities are consistent with individual values (Relation to Values). Lower-level themes concerned specific BA components: Of these, activity scheduling, procedures targeting avoidance, managing uncertainty and social\/communication skills were generally well-received, while mood monitoring, contingency management, and mindfulness had mixed feedback.\nConclusions: BA is a widely scalable intervention that can be adapted for ABI. This study provides a novel framework on implementing a range of BA components in ABI and adds to the limited evidence on which components may be particularly suitable.","tags":["traumatic brain injury","depression","stroke","behavioural activation","qualitative","acquired brain injury","brain tumour"],"date":"2023-02-23T14:23:32.283643","doi":null,"subjects":["Neurocognitive Disorders","Clinical Neuropsychology","Depressive Disorders","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/r47c5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/r47c5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/r47c5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/r47c5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_907"}

It is important to explore the suitability of current platforms; to do this effectively, co-design with people with lived experience (PWLE) is essential. RHED-C (Remote Healthcare for Eating Disorders throughout COVID-19) is a 3-year project focused on future remote care solutions. As part of this larger project, we conducted a two-stage process exploring user experiences with remote care and key design considerations. The first, exploratory stage involved workshops and semi-structured interviews with 27 PWLE based within the UK. Reported barriers included complicated platform functionalities leading to sensory overload and a lack of perceived self-efficacy; poor or unstable internet access disrupting the therapeutic space; a focus upon the quantification of eating disorders (e.g., focus on BMI) that was perceived as triggering. Participants wanted more sharing of honest recovery stories to inspire, and help them to envisage recovery. At the second stage, a creative team comprising  researchers, a service provider and person with lived experience reflected upon these findings to identify provocations for future co-design of remote care based around: i. The value of qualitative research methodologies and avoidance of quantification; ii. Need for design that minimizes physical representation and sensory overload; iii. Importance of honest, recovery-focused content that fosters realistic expectations; iv. promotion of digital accessibility and self-efficacy. These provocations are discussed in this paper.","tags":["codesign","remote support","design","health","remote healthcare","eating disorders","human computer interaction","accessibility","HCI","eating behaviours"],"date":"2023-02-23T14:38:27.936111","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Mental Health"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/fxepc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/fxepc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/fxepc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/fxepc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_908"}

We investigated whether changes to image geometry had an impact on participants\u2019 performance, specifically in terms of non-metric distance estimates. Our multidisciplinary research team developed a new open-source image database to study distance perception in images by systematically manipulating target distance, field of view and image projection using non-linear natural projections. The database consists of 12 outdoor scenes of a virtual 3D urban environment in which a target ball is presented at increasing distance, visualised using both linear perspective and natural perspective images, rendered respectively with three different fields-of-view: 100, 120 and 140 degrees horizontally. In the first experiment (N=52) we tested the effects of linear vs. natural perspective on non-metric distance judgements. In the second experiment (N=195) we investigated the influence of contextual and previous familiarity with linear perspective, and individual differences in spatial skills on distance estimations. The results of both experiments showed that distance estimation accuracy improved in natural compared to linear perspective images, particularly at wide-angle fields-of-view. Moreover, undertaking a training session with only natural perspective images led to more accurate distance judgments overall. We argue that the efficacy of natural perspective may stem from its resemblance to the way objects appear under natural viewing conditions, and that this can provide insights into the phenomenological structure of visual space.","tags":["linear perspective","art","spatial cognition","natural perspective","distance estimation"],"date":"2023-02-23T14:48:46.315955","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Vision","Perception"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/7xack\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/7xack\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/7xack","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/7xack","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_909"}

Based on theories of personality change, we investigated trajectories of big five personality factors (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness) across the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we examined whether demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex), self-reported health status (i.e., physical, mental), and socioeconomic status (i.e., education, income, industry) moderated these trajectories. There was evidence for increases in extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability and decreases in openness across time. The magnitude of these effects suggests between d = .027 to .138 standard deviation changes in these personality characteristics across the three-year timeframe of this study.

{"osf_id":"qzjvb","title":"Leisure engagement and self-perceptions of aging: Longitudinal analysis of concurrent and lagged relationships","description":"Objectives: There is evidence to suggest that leisure engagement may influence self-perceptions of ageing, but disentangling potential bidirectionality in this relationship is challenging. A better understanding of the directionality of this association is essential for designing more effective interventions to promote healthy aging. We therefore tested both lagged and concurrent effects in both directions both for a composite measure of leisure engagement as well as specific domains of community, cognitive, creative, and physical activities.\nMethod: A total of 17,753 adults aged 50 or above living in the United States from the Health and Retirement Study were included in the analysis. They provided 32,703 observations over three waves between 2008\/2010 and 2016\/2018. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling with both concurrent and lagged associations between self-perceptions of aging and leisure engagement, controlling for confounders including age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and health conditions. \nResults: We found consistent evidence for leisure engagement as a predictor of self-perceptions of aging. There was weaker evidence for a reciprocal relationship, although this was found in the domains of creative activities and physical activities, where these two activities were also predicted by older adults\u2019 self-perceptions of aging.\nDiscussion: Our findings provide empirical support for potential benefits of leisure engagement on positive self-perceptions of aging, regardless of the type of activities. As the overall association appears to be stronger between leisure engagement and subsequent self-perceptions of aging, interventions designed to increase leisure engagement may be effective for improving older adults' health.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-23T16:31:07.816943","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Health Psychology","Health-related Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/qzjvb\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/qzjvb\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/qzjvb","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/qzjvb","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_911"}

One approach to population-level monitoring is through the design of surveys that (a) are feasible and cost-effective to implement at scale, (b) yield well-validated summaries of children\u2019s holistic development, and (c) can ideally support comparisons across national and cultural contexts. The Early Childhood Development Index 2030 (ECDI2030) is a caregiver-reported household survey designed to achieve these goals for children aged 24-59 months. This paper describes how the ECDI2030 was developed and provides initial results on its reliability, concurrent validity, and gender equity in nationally representative samples from Mexico (N = 1641) and Palestine (N = 1099). Overall, the results support the use of the ECDI2030 for population-level monitoring, but also suggest that the conceptualization of social-emotional development warrants further attention from researchers.

In turn, researchers and practitioners undertake substantial efforts to increase exercise motivation, or to help exercisers deal more adequately with aversive sensations that are often associated with exercising (e.g., effort, pain). One sensation that appears to be particularly important in this context is boredom: Exercisers frequently turn to online message boards to discuss their exercise-induced boredom, and specialized sports media outlets repeatedly post advice on how to make one\u2019s training less boring. This is in stark contrast to the relative scarcity of boredom research in sports and exercise contexts. \nIn this chapter, we draw on current definitions and theories of boredom to explain why boredom matters for sports and exercise. We demonstrate how boredom can deter people from exercise \u2013 but also draw them to it. Our overview of the literature covers three distinct sports and exercise contexts where boredom might be relevant. First, we review boredom in the context of physical education, then we cover boredom in recreational sports and exercise settings, and we close our review with a discussion of boredom in performance-oriented sports. In these three different contexts, boredom appears to be a powerful factor that affects sports participation and performance. To conclude, boredom matters for sports and exercise, and further research is needed to better understand its relevance.","tags":["exercise","school","physical education","self-regulation","sports","self-control","boredom","physical activity"],"date":"2023-02-23T18:35:11.221855","doi":null,"subjects":["Motivational Behavior","Social and Personality Psychology","Educational Psychology","Sport Psychology","Self-regulation","School Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/y6dkw\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/y6dkw\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/y6dkw","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/y6dkw","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_914"}

Further, as our emotional experiences may help us develop psychological resources, they have important implications for our overall flourishing. Research into the emotions we experience when engaging with visual art, however, has focused on individual emotions separately rather than on global patterns of experienced emotions. The present research used latent class analysis to identify patterns of emotional experiences during art museum visits. Then, it sought to investigate whether people experiencing each emotion pattern during their visit differed in their flourishing experiences. A sample of 613 visitors to one of three art museums completed a survey of their visit experiences, including their emotional experiences and their experiences across five domains of flourishing (psychological distress, empathy, meaning, positive self-regard, and social connection). The analyses resulted in three latent classes\u2014one characterized by above average positive emotions, one characterized by above average negative emotions, and the third characterized by very high levels of negative emotions. Overall, the positive emotion class showed greater flourishing than the two negative emotion classes, with the two negative emotion classes differing only in psychological distress.","tags":["flourishing","emotion","art museum","well-being","latent class analysis"],"date":"2023-02-23T19:31:33.158168","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vm7z8\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vm7z8\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vm7z8","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vm7z8","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_916"}

To contribute to the understanding of active advice seeking, we develop and compare different strategies for information integration from external sources, including Bayesian belief updating. In a reanalysis of empirical data, we find that participants most frequently compromise between their initial beliefs and the distributions of multiple pieces of advice sampled from others. Moreover, across all participants, compromising predicts their final beliefs better than choosing one of the two sources of information. However, participants\u2019 willingness to integrate external opinions is relatively higher for multiple pieces of reasonably distant as compared to close advice. Nevertheless, egocentrism is as pronounced as in the traditional paradigm where only a single piece of external evidence is provided. Crucially, there are large inter- and intra-individual differences in strategy selection for sequential advice taking. On the one hand, some participants choose their own or others\u2019 judgments more often, and other participants are better described as compromisers between internal and external sources of information. On the other hand, virtually all participants apply different advice taking strategies for different items and trials.

Real-world stimuli over which VSL may take place typically have rich interrelationships, such as similarity or categorization. In the present work, we asked whether similarity of constituent items affects VSL. Participants were shown creature stimuli composed of distinct features (e.g., head orientation), with each feature having two possible feature options (e.g., head facing up or head facing to the right). The specific discrete features allowed for systematic manipulation of similarity between paired items in terms of the number of shared and distinct features. Participants viewed stimuli one at a time, in a stream composed of temporally paired items that were either similar (shared majority features) or dissimilar (shared few features). In a test phase, participants performed a forced-choice recognition task, choosing between a target pair previously presented, or a matched-similarity foil pair composed of previously presented items that had been recomposed. Across three experiments, similar pairs were recognized at a higher rate than dissimilar pairs. These results provide evidence of the impact of inter-item similarity on VSL, which may play a strong role in determining the outcomes of everyday VSL.","tags":[],"date":"2023-02-23T20:07:13.451401","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory","Learning"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/guzvn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/guzvn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/guzvn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/guzvn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_918"}

They are a valuable form of scientific collaboration, produce outstanding data sets and are a great resource for third-party researchers. Their data may be reanalyzed and used in research synthesis. Their repositories and code could provide guidance to future projects of this kind. But, while multi-labs are similar in their structure and aggregate their data using meta-analyses, they deploy a variety of different solutions regarding the storage structure in the repositories, the way the (analysis) code is structured and the file-formats they provide. Continuing this trend implies that anyone who wants to work with data from multiple of these projects, or combine their datasets, is faced with an ever-increasing complexity. Some of that complexity could be avoided. Here, we introduce MetaPipeX, a standardized framework to harmonize, document, analyze and multi-lab data. It features a pipeline conceptualization of the analysis and documentation process, an R-package that implements both and a Shiny App that allows users to explore and visualize these data sets. We introduce the framework by describing its components and applying it to a practical example. Engaging with this form of collaboration and integrating it further into research practice will certainly be beneficial to quantitative sciences and we hope the framework provides a structure and tools to reduce effort for anyone who creates, re-uses, harmonizes or learns about multi-lab replication projects.","tags":["multilab","experiment","open materials","meta-analysis","code","data documentation","data visualization"],"date":"2023-02-23T21:04:50.139832","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bcpkt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bcpkt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bcpkt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bcpkt","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_919"}

We found that monolingual adults\u2019 eye movement patterns exhibited a fluent scanpath reading process, representing effortless processing of the written material: They read straight from left to right at a fast pace, skipped words, and regressed rarely. Both high-proficiency heritage-language speakers\u2019 and second graders\u2019 eye movement patterns exhibited an intermediate scanpath reading process, characterized by a slower pace, longer fixations, an absence of word skipping, and short regressive saccades. Second-language learners and low-proficiency heritage-language speakers exhibited a beginner reading process that involved the slowest pace, even longer fixations, no word skipping, and frequent rereading of the whole sentence and of particular words. We suggest that unlike intermediate readers who use the respective process to resolve local processing difficulties (e.g., word recognition failure), beginner readers, in addition, experience global-level challenges in semantic and morphosyntactic information integration. Proficiency in Russian for heritage-language speakers and comprehension scores for second-language learners were the only individual difference factors predictive of the scanpath reading process adopted by bilingual speakers.

Consequently, many clients in psychotherapy ask questions about meaning in life. Overall, meaning-centered therapies have positive effects, but there are often large differences between therapies, missing information from treatment manuals, and unsupported therapeutic components. Therefore, the literature was systematically reviewed on meaning and meaning-centered therapies to systematically develop a comprehensive meaning-centered treatment manual.\nAim: This article describes the development of Systematic Meaning in life Psychotherapy (SMP) which helps individuals live a meaningful and satisfying life despite life\u2019s challenges. SMP integrates common denominators identified in effective meaning-centered therapies and that are supported by systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses on meaning in life. \nMethods: The treatment manual was developed via five rounds of systematic literature-reviews and meta-analyses on philosophical foundations, meaning in psycho-oncology, meaning-centered therapies, assumptions in meaning-centered therapies, and translations into a manual.\nResults: SMP consists of 10 sessions: sessions 1-3 examine the relevance of meaning and historical resilience, and session 9-10 help clients make decisions, set goals and change daily-life. In sessions 5-8, cancer-clients are asked to systematically reflect on past, present or future examples of six universal types and 29 sub-types of meaning in life: materialistic, hedonistic, self-oriented, social, larger and existential-philosophical types\/subtypes of meaning. Clients are stimulated to develop a critical-intuitive\/phenomenological approach to life instead of a dominantly traditional or functionalistic approach. Therapists use assessment, meaning-oriented, relational, experiential\/phenomenological and existential-therapeutic competencies. Sessions usually consist of an emotional check-in, discussing homework, agenda-setting, mindfulness\/experiential exercises, self-reflective questions, sharing, decision-making, homework-setting and ending.  \nDiscussion: SMP is a common-denominator therapy systematically grounded in the currently available empirical research. Over 2000 therapists have been trained in SMP and apply this in psycho-oncology settings. Several trials discussed elsewhere indicate that SMP has large positive effects, which are explained\/mediated by the hypothesized therapeutic mechanisms.","tags":["life","treatment","Frankl","guideline","psychotherapy","meaning in life","trial","coherence","counselling","coaching","intervention","existential therapy","purpose","mindfulness","research","evidence-based","existential","humanism","eudaimonia","psychology","spiritual","humanistic therapy","life review","positive psychology","logotherapy"],"date":"2023-02-23T23:36:59.542873","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Therapy","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/xbk85\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/xbk85\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/xbk85","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/xbk85","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_922"}

(2023) confirming applicability in a general population cohort","description":"Background: Identifying language disorders earlier ensures children receive the support needed to improve developmental outcomes and quality of life. Despite the prevalence and impacts of persistent language disorder, there are surprisingly no robust predictor tools available. \nAims: Here we first aimed to externally validate a predictor set of six variables previously identified to be predictive of language at 11 years of age, using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) birth cohort. Secondly, we examined whether new LSAC variables arose as predictive of language outcome.\nMethods: 5107 children were recruited to LSAC with developmental measures collected from 0-3 years. At 11-12 years, children completed the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th Edition, Recalling Sentences subtest. We used SuperLearner to estimate the accuracy of six previously identified parent-reported variables from ages 2-3 years in predicting low language (sentence recall score \u22651.5SD below the mean) at 11-12-years. Random forests were used to identify any additional variables predictive of language outcome.\nResults: Complete data was available for 523 participants (52.20% girls; 27, 5.16%, had a low language score). The six predictors yielded fair accuracy: 78% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, CI: [58,91]) and 71% specificity (95% CI: [67, 75]). These predictors relate to sentence complexity, vocabulary and behavior. The random forests analysis identified similar predictors. \nConclusions: We identified an ultra-short set of variables that predicts 11-year language outcome with \u201cfair\u201d accuracy. In one of few replication studies of this scale in the field, these methods have now been conducted across two population-based cohorts, with consistent results.

{"osf_id":"5jzup","title":"Dynamic Face Perception: The Role of Expertise in Dual Processing of Features and Configuration","description":"Face perception is the basis of many types of social information exchange, but there is controversy over its underlying mechanisms. Researchers have theorized two processing pathways underlying facial perception: configural processing and featural processing. Featural processing focuses on the individual features of a face, whereas configural processing focuses on the spatial relations of features. To resolve the debate on the relative contribution of the two pathways in face perception, researchers have proposed a dual processing model that the two pathways contribute to two different perceptions, detecting face-like patterns and identifying individual faces. The dual processing model is based on face perception experiments that primarily use static faces. As we mostly interact with dynamic faces in real life, the generalization of the model to dynamic faces will advance our understanding of how faces are perceived in real life. This paper proposes a refined dual processing model of dynamic face perception, in which expertise in dynamic face perception supports identifying individual faces, and it is a learned behaviour that develops with age. Specifically, facial motions account for the advantages of dynamic faces, compared to static faces. This paper highlights two intrinsic characteristics of facial motions that enable the advantages of dynamic faces in face perception. Firstly, facial motion provides facial information from various viewpoints, and thus supports the generalization of face perception to the unlearned view of faces. Secondly, distinctive motion patterns serve as a cue to the identity of the face.","tags":["featural processing","face recognition","face expertise","facial motion","configural processing"],"date":"2023-02-24T06:17:04.000483","doi":"10.33137\/juls.v16i1.40382","subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5jzup\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5jzup\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5jzup","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5jzup","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.33137\/juls.v16i1.40382","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_924"}
{"osf_id":"cmd6h","title":"Using a cognitive model to understand crowdsourced data from citizen scientists","description":"Threatened species monitoring can produce enormous quantities of acoustic and visual recordings which need to be searched for animal detections. Coding the data is extremely time-consuming for humans and even though machine algorithms are emerging as a useful tool to tackle this daunting task, they too require large amounts of known detections for training. Citizen scientists are often recruited via crowd-sourcing to assist. However, the results of their coding can be difficult to interpret because citizen scientists lack comprehensive training and typically each code only a small fraction of the full data set. Competence may vary between citizen scientists, but without knowing the ground truth of the data set, it is difficult to identify which scientists are most competent. We used a quantitative cognitive model, cultural consensus theory, to analyze both empirical and simulated data from a crowdsourced analysis of audio recordings of Australian frogs. Several hundred citizen scientists were asked whether the calls of nine frog species were present on 1,260 brief audio recordings, though most only coded a small fraction of these recordings. Through modeling, characteristics of both the scientist cohort and the recordings were estimated, to identify trends in competence in the former and frog calls in the latter.

This finding adds to the evidence that crowdsourced analyses can be utilised to understand large-scale datasets, even when the ground truth of the dataset is unknown.

{"osf_id":"m93pd","title":"Contextualized Construct Representation: Leveraging Psychometric Scales to Advance Theory-Driven Text Analysis","description":"Over the past decades, text-analysis methods have been slowly integrated into the toolbox of methods used to reliably measure psychological constructs. Yet, many of the existing computational methods in psychological text analysis remain atheoretical and lack the interpretability that social sciences are accustomed to and desire. Here, we introduce a novel method for theory-driven text analysis by bridging the power of contextual language models and common psychometric scales. The new technique, which we call Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR), retains high levels of interpretability and top-down flexibility, but makes use of state-of-the-art language models developed in natural language processing (NLP). CCR is a flexible technique that will be able to adapt to the continuously progressing set of tools for language modeling. We discuss how our proposed technique quantifies psychological information in textual data, and demonstrate in two studies (N = 2,996) that CCR outperforms other top-down methods (i.e., word-counting and word-embedding representations) in predicting an array of psychological outcomes common in social and personality psychology, including moral values, the need for cognition, political ideology, strength of norms, and cultural orientation. We provide an accompanying R package, Python library, and develop an interface for researchers to conveniently use CCR in their research.","tags":["natural language processing","social psychology","computational psychology","theory-driven text analysis","personality psychology","text analysis","computational social science"],"date":"2023-02-24T06:37:08.450573","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Social and Personality Psychology","Linguistics","Cognitive Psychology","Quantitative Methods","Computational Linguistics","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/m93pd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/m93pd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/m93pd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/m93pd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_926"}

To know whether to repeat behaviors that help or harm, we must learn from their outcomes. But the neurocomputational processes supporting such simultaneous learning remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, two independent samples learned to make choices that simultaneously affected themselves and another person. Detailed model comparison showed that people integrate self- and other-relevant information into a single cached value per choice, but update this value asymmetrically based on different types of prediction errors related to the target (e.g., self, other) and valence (e.g., positive, negative). People who acquire more prosocial patterns are more sensitive to information about how their choices affect others. However, those with higher levels of subclinical psychopathic traits are relatively insensitive to unexpected outcomes for others. Model-based neuroimaging revealed distinct brain regions tracking prediction errors guided by the asymmetric value update. These results demonstrate that the way people distinctly encode self- and other-relevant outcomes resulting from their behavior guides how desirable the same behavior will be in the future, regardless of whether it is mutually beneficial or costly, instrumentally harmful, or altruistic.","tags":["altruism","neuroimaging","psychopathy","prosocial behavior","equity","instrumental harm","computational modeling","reinforcement learning","social behavior","social learning","antisocial behavior"],"date":"2023-02-24T07:17:51.785464","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Judgment and Decision Making","Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Learning","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Prosocial Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rf4x9\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rf4x9\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rf4x9","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rf4x9","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_928"}

We propose a novel neural mechanism of archetypes, grounded in cross-cultural psychology, comparative mythology, as well as developmental psychology. The pragmatic function of archetypes may serve as a collective effort of free energy minimization under the free energy principle, emergent due to the sets of affordances offered by culture and ecology. In line with Carl Jung\u2019s definitional scope, we argue that archetypes are rooted in deep ecological and social forces, generationally ingrained for the purpose of optimizing the accurate conceptual representation of agents\u2019 ecological and social environments.

Commonly used statistical models for those designs are multilevel models with autocorrelated errors. To then examine substantive hypotheses of interest, statistical hypothesis tests are conducted for the effects of interest in the fitted multilevel model. An important question in the design of such IL studies concerns the determination of the number of participants and the number of measurements per person needed to achieve sufficient statistical power. Recent advances in computational methods and software enable the computation of statistical power using Monte Carlo simulation. Unfortunately, this approach is highly computationally intensive. We, therefore, derive analytical formulas for statistical power in multilevel models with AR(1) within-person errors. Analytic expressions are obtained via asymptotic approximations for the unknown quantities in the information matrices of the fixed effects. To validate this analytical approach, we perform a series of simulations to compare its performance to the simulation-based approach. The approaches perform similarly thereby making the analytic approach a viable option for researchers that can significantly reduce the computational burden.","tags":["linear mixed effect models","intensive longitudinal designs","statistical power","multilevel models","AR(1) errors"],"date":"2023-02-24T09:43:44.679603","doi":null,"subjects":["Statistical Methods","Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Quantitative Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/tj5bv\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/tj5bv\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/tj5bv","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/tj5bv","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_930"}

Owing to recent legislative developments in the United Kingdom that criminalize coercive control under the Domestic Abuse Act (2021), this study offers a timely investigation into the mechanisms of sexual coercion in domestic abuse across sexual abuse and coercive control. We used moderation analysis (n = 405) to investigate whether sexual coercion proclivity was predicted by facets of atypical sexuality (non-clinical elevated levels of sex drive, sexual sadism, and sexual masochism), and whether this relationship was moderated by psychopathic personality traits specifically the factor one components, which encompasses interpersonal and affective characteristics). Psychopathic personality traits significantly moderated the positive association between sex drive and sexual coercion proclivity, and between sexual sadism and sexual coercion proclivity in males (but not females), but psychopathic personality traits had no such moderating effect in the sexual masochism model.

This is typically assessed behaviourally using the Stimulus Response Compatibility (SRC) task, where participants are presented with either congruent or incongruent prompt-distractor pairings (an incongruent trial instructs participants to press down their index finger paired with a video of a middle-finger press). Automatic imitation is taken as the response time and accuracy differences between congruent and incongruent trials, with faster and more accurate responses observed for congruent trials. Whilst a wealth of research has been conducted on automatic imitation, little work has assessed its automaticity. In this paper, we focussed on the efficiency dimension of automaticity. An efficient behaviour operates independently of central resources, persisting under concurrent load. Experiments 1 and 2 assessed the efficiency of imitation, with participants completing either speech- or manual-motor SRC trials under high, medium or low-load induced with a sequence memory task. In both experiments, the presence of a two-way between load and congruency would suggest that load is inefficient. The results for both studies, however, provided robust evidence against the presence of a load by congruency interaction, demonstrating the efficiency of imitation. These results add to a growing body of work suggesting that automatic imitation can be termed efficient, and therefore automatic on this criterion.","tags":["Hand-motor imitation","Speech-motor imitation","Cognitive Load","Automatic Imitation","Stimulus Response Compatibility","Efficiency","Automaticity"],"date":"2023-02-24T14:26:00.605590","doi":null,"subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Action","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/gam3w\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/gam3w\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gam3w","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gam3w","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_935"}

Theoretical models suggest that following a stressful event, maladaptive metacognitive evaluations and appraisals of the event drive development of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Yet it is unclear whether disruptions to metacognition causes or contributes to symptom development, or are simply a consequence of ongoing psychopathology. In two studies, using hierarchical Bayesian modelling of metacognition combined with a memory encoding task, we assessed whether distortions to metacognition occur at a state-level after an acute stress induction, or at a trait-level in a sample of individuals experiencing intrusive memories following traumatic stress. Study 1 indicated that heightened perceived stress was associated with impairments in metacognitive efficiency on a memory test after a stress induction (N=27). Study 2 demonstrated that a transdiagnostic sample of individuals experiencing intrusive memories following a traumatic stressor (N=39) showed no significant differences in metacognitive efficiency compared to matched controls on the same memory test (N=45). Our results show that alterations to metacognition do not occur in patients experiencing intrusive memories following traumatic stress, but instead are associated with temporary, heighted levels of acute stress. This suggests that differential sensitivity to acute stress, rather than ongoing psychopathology, induces metacognitive impairments, which could predispose individuals to future mental health problems via downstream changes to other cognitive processes.","tags":["Metacognition","Episodic memory","Inflammation","PTSD","Psychiatric Disorders"],"date":"2023-02-24T14:31:07.179533","doi":null,"subjects":["Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hdv3k\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/hdv3k\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/hdv3k","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hdv3k","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_936"}

Self-related motor information is utilised by self-other monitoring processes like implicit measures of a sense of agency. Intentional binding is one such process that focuses on the temporal shift between a voluntary action and the sensory consequence. Recently, it was discovered that self-related information from visual stimuli could also affect retrospective intentional binding. Considering the importance of the left temporoparietal junction (l-TPJ) in self-other monitoring, we explored its causal role by modulating its activity with high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). We predicted increased self-associated saliency and intentional binding from anodal HD-tDCS to l-TPJ compared to baseline and cathodal stimulation conditions. \nMethods: Fifteen healthy right-handed participants performed two computerized tasks: sound-label matching and intentional binding tasks. Behavioural data were collected at baseline and following randomly ordered anodal and cathodal HD-tDCS of l-TPJ. Anodal and cathodal HD-tDCS were administered to all the participants in two different sessions and were separated by at least 72 hours.\nResults: Strong self-bias effect was observed in all conditions. We didn\u2019t note a retrospective intentional binding effect between self-associated and other-associated sounds in any of the conditions. HD-tDCS indicates a dual and crucial role of l-TPJ in general mismatch detection and other-associated stimulus representation in the self-bias effect.\nConclusion: The results suggest a diverse role of l-TPJ in self-reference networks and general mismatch detection.","tags":["sense of agency","Retrospective intentional binding","non-invasive brain stimulation","Temporo-parietal junction","HD-tDCS (High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)","self-bias effect"],"date":"2023-02-24T15:08:08.567379","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108683","subjects":["Perception","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Action"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/x5n3j\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/x5n3j\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/x5n3j","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/x5n3j","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108683","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_937"}

However, research on the effects of defending students demonstrated positive and negative social-emotional adjustment. To explain these mixed findings, researchers have suggested that associations between defending and social-emotional adjustment may be buffered by protective factors (i.e., defender protection hypothesis) or exacerbated by vulnerability factors (i.e., defender vulnerability hypothesis). In line with these hypotheses, the current study aimed to investigate whether relationships with teachers and peers moderate the association be-tween defending and social-emotional adjustment, i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem. This three-wave longitudinal study examined the association between peer-nominated defending, and later self-reported depressive symptoms and self-esteem in 848 fourth-to-sixth graders (53% girls; Mage = 10.61 years, SD = 0.90 at Wave 1). Peer-nominated positive and negative teacher-student relationships (closeness, conflict) and peer relationships (acceptance, rejection) were used. Clustered multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that defending behavior did not predict later depressive symptoms or self-esteem. Contrary to our expectations, teacher-student closeness, peer acceptance and their combination did not play a protective role in the association between de-fending and social-emotional adjustment. In addition, teacher-student conflict, peer rejection and their combination did not put defending students at risk for social-emotional maladjustment. Thus, relationships with teachers and peers did not moderate the association between defending and later depressive symptoms and self-esteem.","tags":["school bullying","peer relationships","teacher-student relationships","social-emotional adjustment","defending behavior","protective factors","risk factors"],"date":"2023-02-24T15:37:53.148553","doi":null,"subjects":["School Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/cxsmy\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/cxsmy\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/cxsmy","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/cxsmy","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_939"}

Shortened stems, for example, can indicate an upcoming suffix, while lengthened ones can indicate a word boundary follows. Previous work has shown that listeners draw on these cues to distinguish multisyllabic from monosyllabic target words. In this project, we ask whether (i) listeners use these cues to distinguish words that differ only in morphological structure with no change in syllable count; (ii) whether the redundancy of these cues in the immediate sentence affects listener attentiveness; and (iii) whether linguistic experience can change how listeners learn or use these cues.  In two visual-world eye-tracking studies, in English and Spanish, we presented listeners with utterances containing target nouns whose stem durations were manipulated to provide cues to the presence or absence of a plural suffix. The redundancy of these cues was manipulated across different sentence contexts: Sentences in which agreeing determiners indicated noun number rendered the stem duration cues redundant, while sentences with no determiners rendered the cues more informative. In both experiments, listeners attended to acoustic cues signalling an upcoming suffix even when the sentence context rendered such cues redundant. Further, in Experiment 2 high-proficiency Spanish-English bilinguals were more sensitive to such cues than low-proficiency bilinguals, suggesting a phonetic bilingual advantage in speech perception.

Talking faces supplement the auditory signal by providing fine phonetic cues based on the placement of the articulators, as well as temporal cues to when speech is occurring. In this study, we varied the amount of information contained in the visual signal, ranging from temporal information alone to a natural talking face. Participants were presented with spoken sentences in energetic or informational masking in four different visual conditions: audio-only, a modulating circle providing temporal cues to salient features of the speech, a digitally rendered point-light display showing lip movement, and a natural talking face. We assessed both sentence identification accuracy and self-reported listening effort. Audiovisual benefit for intelligibility was observed for the natural face in both informational and energetic masking, but the digitally rendered point-light display only provided benefit in energetic masking. Intelligibility for speech accompanied by the modulating circle did not differ from the audio-only conditions in either masker type.","tags":["speech perception","audiovisual benefit","visual enhancement","audiovisual speech"],"date":"2023-02-24T19:26:03.786104","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Language"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/vq46h\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/vq46h\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/vq46h","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/vq46h","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_941"}

Across three experiments testing semantic decision, word recognition, and lexical decision, we show that the amount of time people say it takes to perceive something in the world (e.g., haircut, dandelion, or merit) predicts how long it takes for them to respond to a word referring to that thing, over and above the effects of other lexical-semantic variables (e.g., word frequency, concreteness) and other variables related to conceptual complexity (e.g., how much physical space is required to perceive a concept, or the diversity of the contexts in which a concept appears). These results suggest that our experience of how long it takes to recognize an instance of something can become a part of its representation, and that we simulate this information when we read a word referring to it.

{"osf_id":"es2kc","title":"Higher amplitudes in steady-state visual evoked potentials driven by square-wave versus sine-wave contrast modulation \u2013 a dual-laboratory study.","description":"Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) are an established tool for assessing visuocortical responses in visual perception and attention. They have the same temporal frequency characteristics as a periodically modulated stimulus (e.g., in contrast or luminance) that drives them. It has been hypothesized that the amplitude of a given ssVEP may depend on the shape of the stimulus modulation function, but the size and robustness of these effects is not well established. The current study systematically compared the effect of the two most common functions in the ssVEP literature, square-wave and sine-wave functions. Across two laboratories, we presented mid-complex color patterns to 30 participants with square-wave or sine-wave contrast modulation and at different driving frequencies (6 Hz, 8.57 Hz, 15 Hz). When ssVEPs were analyzed independently for the samples, with each laboratory\u2019s standard processing pipeline, ssVEP amplitudes in both samples decreased at higher driving frequencies and square-wave modulation evoked higher amplitudes at lower frequencies (i.e., 6 Hz, 8.57 Hz) compared to sine-wave modulation. These effects were replicated when samples were aggregated and analyzed with the same processing pipeline. In addition, when using signal-to-noise ratios as outcome measures, this joint analysis indicated a somewhat weaker effect of increased ssVEP amplitudes to square-wave modulation at 15 Hz. The present study suggests that square-wave modulation should be used in ssVEP research when the goal is to maximize signal amplitude or signal-to-noise ratio. Given effects of modulation function across laboratories, and data processing pipelines, the findings appear robust to differences in data collection and analysis.","tags":["square-wave","sine-wave","modulation function","EEG","ssVEP","visual perception"],"date":"2023-02-25T01:50:35.653187","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/es2kc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/es2kc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/es2kc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/es2kc","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_947"}

{"osf_id":"yx4gd","title":"A comparison of basic color terms in Mandarin and Spanish","description":"Humans can discriminate between hundreds of colors, which are clustered into a smaller number of color categories that can receive distinctive linguistic labels. Being color perception universal, languages differ in the set of basic color terms (BCTs) they have. Despite numerous prior studies, the exact number of BCTs in Mandarin (Sino-Tibetan, China) and Spanish (Indo-European, Spain) is still debated. Also, cross-linguistic differences can be expected with regards to how BCTs are used for referring to color, as well as concerning the naming strategies used for making reference more specific. For clarifying this, we recruited 21 speakers of Mainland Mandarin and 21 speakers of Castilian Spanish and assessed them in two related tasks: the list task, in which participants are asked to write down as many color names as they can recall; and the color naming task, in which they were asked to name color chips from the Munsell color chart that are presented randomly. Our results suggest that Mandarin has 9 BCTs, while Spanish has 12 BCTs. Additionally, we found that, in order to make color reference more exact, speakers of Mandarin use more modified terms and compounds, whereas speakers of Spanish rely more on monomorphemic non-basic terms. Finally, we observed that speakers of Mandarin use some colors (gray, blue and purple) less consistently, although the color space is partitioned similarly by these two languages. Our results reinforce the view that there are universal constraints on color naming, that are compatible with subtle cross-cultural differences in how colors are used.","tags":["color categorization","color perception","cross-linguistic differences","Basic color terms","color naming strategies"],"date":"2023-02-25T09:40:04.118859","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Linguistics"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/yx4gd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/yx4gd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/yx4gd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/yx4gd","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_949"}
{"osf_id":"s53pq","title":"The Truth is in There: Belief Processes in the Human Brain","description":"Belief has been defined by William James as the mental state or function of cognizing reality, and is a core psychological function with a strong influence on emotional states and behavior. Further, strong and aberrant beliefs about the world and oneself play important roles in mental disorders. The underlying processes of belief have been the matter of a long and intensive debate in philosophy and psychology, and modern neuroimaging techniques might provide important insight into the underlying neural processes.\nBased on seminal neuroimaging work on belief by Harris et al. (2008), we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with N=30 healthy participants in which we presented 100 statements about facts, politics, religion, conspiracy theories, and superstition. For each statement, participants judged whether they considered it as true (belief) or not (disbelief), and reported their certainty in the decision.\nFor the contrast belief &gt; disbelief we found activations in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left superior parietal cortex, and left lateral frontopolar cortex. For the contrast disbelief &gt; belief we found an anterior temporal cluster extending into the amygdala. We replicated a larger deactivation for disbelief than belief in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but in the decision phase and not during statement presentation, suggesting a role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in belief-related decision making. When we analyzed category-specific effects, we found significantly higher activation in the retrosplenial cortex and parahippocampal gyrus for disbelief &gt; belief for conspiracy theory statements.\nExploratory analyses of linear associations with certainty and uncertainty identified networks centered at the anterior cingulate cortex for certainty, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for uncertainty. The dorsomedial prefrontal uncertainty effect identifies a neural substrate for Alexander Bain\u2019s notion from 1859 of uncertainty as the real opposite of belief.\nTaken together, our results suggest a two-factor neural process model of belief with falsehood\/veracity and uncertainty\/certainty factors.","tags":["belief","uncertainty","dorsomedial prefrontal cortex","functional magnetic resonance imaging","ventromedial prefrontal cortex"],"date":"2023-02-25T10:33:41.312260","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/s53pq\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/s53pq\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/s53pq","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/s53pq","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_950"}

In this direction, this paper examines the effects of cybersickness on cognitive, motor, and reading performance in VR. Also, this paper evaluates the mitigating effects of music on cybersickness, as well as the role of gender, and the computing, VR, and gaming experience of the user. This paper reports two studies. In the 1st study, 92 participants selected the music tracks considered most calming (low valence) or joyful (high valence) to be used in the 2nd study. In the 2nd study, 39 participants performed an assessment four times, once before the rides (baseline), and then once after each ride (3 rides). In each ride either Calming, or Joyful, or No Music was played. During each ride, linear and angular accelerations took place to induce cybersickness in the participants. In each assessment, while immersed in VR, the participants evaluated their cybersickness symptomatology and performed a verbal working memory task, a visuospatial working memory task, and a psychomotor task. While responding to the cybersickness questionnaire (3D UI), eye-tracking was conducted to measure reading time and pupillometry. The results showed that Joyful and Calming music substantially decreased the intensity of nausea-related symptoms. However, only Joyful music significantly decreased the overall cybersickness intensity. Importantly, cybersickness was found to decrease verbal working memory performance and pupil size. Also, it significantly decelerated psychomotor (reaction time) and reading abilities. Higher gaming experience was associated with lower cybersickness. When controlling for gaming experience, there were no significant differences between female and male participants in terms of cybersickness. The outcomes indicated the efficiency of music in mitigating cybersickness, the important role of gaming experience in cybersickness, and the significant effects of cybersickness on pupil size, cognition, psychomotor skills, and reading ability.","tags":["IT skills","motor speed","Reading time","visuospatial working memory","joyful music","eye-hand coordination","gaze tracking","cognition","VR sickness","psychomotor skills","simulator sickness","relaxation","HCI","reading time","calming music","eye-tracking","gaming experience","pupillometry","pupil size","verbal working memory","motor skills","motion sickness","cybersickness","cognitive decline","mitigation techniques","music","gender","reading speed","reaction time","attentional speed","sex","computing experience","human-computer interaction","mitigation"],"date":"2023-02-25T11:12:06.255145","doi":"10.1109\/TVCG.2023.3247062","subjects":["Linguistics","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Music","Engineering Psychology","Consumer Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/6j2wt\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/6j2wt\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/6j2wt","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/6j2wt","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1109\/TVCG.2023.3247062","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_951"}

The sociocognitive model proposes that greater responsiveness to suggestion (suggestibility) among dissociative disorder patients facilitates false memories of trauma through an admixture of processes including iatrogenesis and responsiveness to sociocultural cues (Figure 1a). By contrast, the trauma model maintains that dissociation functions as a coping response to traumatic stress that progresses to psychopathology in certain individuals independently of suggestion (Figure 1b).

{"osf_id":"wd8r5","title":"Sex Differences in Neuroendocrine, Sympathetic Nervous System, and Affect Responses to Acute Stress in Cannabis Users","description":"Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the United States and is often reportedly used for stress reduction. Indeed, cannabinoids modulate signaling of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system. However, the role of biological sex in this interaction between cannabis use and stress is poorly understood, despite sex differences in neurobiological stress responsivity, endocannabinoid signaling, and clinical correlates of cannabis use. Frequent cannabis users (&gt;3x\/week, n=48, 52% male) and non-users (n=41, 49% male) participated in an acute psychosocial stress paradigm. Saliva was collected at eight timepoints and analyzed for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (cortisol) and sympathetic (alpha-amylase) indices of stress responsivity, and estradiol at baseline. Subjective ratings of negative affect, including distress, were collected at three timepoints. Cannabis users showed blunted cortisol responsivity and lower alpha-amylase output overall compared to non-users, with no statistical differences between groups on overall negative affect reactivity. Aberrant stress responsivity in cannabis users was driven by females, with significant sex by time interactions for cortisol and alpha-amylase responsivity in cannabis users only. Female cannabis users demonstrated the greatest change in subjective distress across timepoints. Differences in stress responsivity were not explained by estradiol or distress intolerance. Biological sex may moderate multisystem stress responsivity in cannabis users. Paradoxically, female cannabis users showed the least physiological, but greatest subjective, responsivity to the stressor. Further research into sex differences in the effects of cannabis use is warranted to better understand mechanisms and clinical implications.","tags":["distress","cortisol","alpha-amylase","subjective affect","acute stress","cannabis","sex differences"],"date":"2023-02-25T23:56:45.488617","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Substance Abuse and Addiction","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Clinical Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wd8r5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wd8r5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wd8r5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wd8r5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_957"}

Demonstrating this relationship is critical if we expect speech and communication deficits to emerge as targets for early intervention.\nMethod: we analyzed three one-minute speech samples using automated speech analysis and Bayes networks in an antipsychotic-naive sample of 39 FEP patients and followed them longitudinally to determine their vocational status (engaged or not engaged in employment education or training - EET vs. NEET) after 6-12 months of treatment. Five linguistic variables with prior evidence of clinical relevance (total and acausal connectives use, pronoun use, analytic thinking, and total words uttered in a limited period) were included in a Bayes network along with longitudinal NEET status and Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) scores to determine dependencies among our variables. We also included clinical (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 8-item version (PANSS-8)), social (parental In review socioeconomic status,) and cognitive features (processing speed) at the time of presentation as covariates.\nResults: The Bayes network revealed that only total words spoken were directly associated with NEET and had an indirect association with SOFAS, with a second set of dependencies emerging among the remaining linguistic variables. The primary (speech-only) model outperformed\nmodels including parental socioeconomic status, processing speed or both as latent variables.\nConclusion: impoverished speech, even at subclinical levels, may hold prognostic value and warrant clinical consideration when treating first-episode psychosis.","tags":["Vocational Outcome; First Episode Psychosis; Bayesian statistics; automated linguistic analysis","automated linguistic analysis","First Episode Psychosis","NLP","Natural Language Processing","Bayesian statistics","Vocational Outcome"],"date":"2023-02-26T00:29:26.441685","doi":null,"subjects":["Psychiatry"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/hy2dj\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/hy2dj\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/hy2dj","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hy2dj","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_958"}

Here, we increased the demand on episodic memory in a sensory preconditioning task to assess whether and how episodic memory contributes to threat generalization. Participants encoded forty unique episodes, each consisting of two neutral stimuli, after which one of each pair was newly associated with either an aversive or a neutral stimulus on the following day. Another day later, both stimuli of the original memories were found to trigger enhanced pupil dilation if one was indirectly linked with an aversive stimulus. This effect was independent of whether the declarative associations encoded on day one were accurately retained on the day of testing, and confined to trials on which the indirectly associated stimulus was consciously brought to mind, suggesting an important role for relational memory processes. There was no moderating effect of trait-anxiety. The present study demonstrates that the human defensive system is remarkably adept at quickly anticipating threat based on information acquired over separate events, and gives a first glimpse into how this ability is facilitated by episodic memory.","tags":["Threat learning","Episodic memory","Sensory preconditioning"],"date":"2023-02-26T14:07:45.710286","doi":null,"subjects":["Learning","Cognitive Psychology","Memory","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Emotion"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/bg8wn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/bg8wn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/bg8wn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bg8wn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_959"}

Transitional Justice for Indigenous Peoples in American Psychology","description":"In October 2021, the American Psychological Association (APA) apologized to People of Color in the U.S. for its role in \u201cpromoting, perpetuating, and failing to challenge racism, racial discrimination, and human hierarchy\u201d (2021a, p. 1). In the context of a national racial reckoning, Indigenous Peoples have been regularly incorporated into initiatives redressing America\u2019s legacy of racism. Although Indigenous Peoples have been racialized during the formation of the U.S., this process has been deeply entangled with colonization \u2014 the systematic dispossession and exploitation of Indigenous communities by Europeans. We first examine how APA has been complicit in colonialism by failing to oppose government policies that disenfranchise Indigenous communities (Woolf et al., 2022). Second, we explore possibilities for APA to reconcile historical and contemporary wrongs inflicted on Indigenous Peoples through transitional justice, an approach to addressing human rights violations that seeks justice and opportunities for healing (United Nations, 2008). In particular, we consider the implications that Truth and Reconciliation Commissions have for Indigenous Peoples. Third, we provide recommendations for APA to repair relations with Indigenous Peoples in 1) education, 2) research, and 3) practice. Specifically, we interrogate what possibilities for truth, reconciliation, and healing exist vis-\u00e0-vis transitional justice initiatives in psychology. We conclude with the potential APA has to advance meaningful reforms, while cautioning against superficial efforts towards reconciliation.","tags":["Indigenous Peoples","Reconciliation","APA","Transitional Justice","Apology"],"date":"2023-02-26T15:52:00.171613","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/pcvws\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/pcvws\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/pcvws","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/pcvws","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_961"}

Additionally, we examined associations between positive and negative psychosocial functioning, with profiles of cultural stressors and acculturation. Method: The current study utilized baseline data drawn from a daily diary study on acculturation collected at a large public Hispanic Serving Institution. The sample for this study consisted of 779 HL college students (75.8% female, Mage=20.80 years, SD=2.66). Results: Latent Profile Analysis identified four distinct profiles. The Bicultural and Low Cultural Stressors (B-LowCS; 53.55%) was marked by heritage and U.S. cultural orientation and low levels across all cultural stressors. The Marginalization and High Acculturative Stressors (M-HighAS; 20.13%) was marked by low heritage and U.S. cultural orientation, high acculturative stressors, and low discrimination. The third profile, the Heritage Rejection and Low Cultural Stressors (HR-LowCS; 16.05%) was marked by rejection of heritage culture and low cultural stressors. Finally, the Separation and High Cultural Stressors (S-HighCS; 10.26%) was marked by low U.S. cultural orientation and high cultural stressors. Consistent with passed research, the B-LowCS profile was marked by the highest level of psychosocial functioning, and the lowest levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

Even less research has explored the specific components of such interventions that might contribute to or detract from group processes and performance. To organize and spur this line of inquiry, we reviewed the literature on learning objectives, training outcomes, and best practice recommendations for personality-based training. We also interviewed 26 trainers who use personality assessments, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, DISC, CliftonStrengths, and Hogan Personality Inventory, concerning these topics. We organized their responses to each topic into categories, using thematic content analyses for the learning objectives and training recommendations. Common learning objectives involve increasing self- and other-awareness, preference for personality diversity, interpersonal skill, and individual- and unit-level attitudes and performance. Anecdotal reports generally suggest personality-based training can improve self-awareness and interpersonal skill, but some reports describe risk of stigmatization and subgroup conflict. Differing approaches to these trainings appear to vary in their effectiveness. Common best practice recommendations from trainers include describing personality flexibly, emphasizing the value of personality diversity, tailoring the training content based on group personality profiles, ensuring trainees understand that personality testing is for developmental purposes, and treating personality feedback as confidential. We conclude by summarizing existing guidance for practitioners and suggesting two future research streams: (1) controlled evaluation of training outcomes and (2) exploration of the proposed mechanisms of action in personality-based training.","tags":["team building","team training","interview","group training","personality"],"date":"2023-02-26T20:42:04.815717","doi":"10.1037\/cpb0000251","subjects":["Workgroup and Teams","Industrial and Organizational Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Training and Development"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/2jnwd\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/2jnwd\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/2jnwd","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/2jnwd","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/cpb0000251","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_963"}

Increased availability of telehealth services has been denoted a point of equity in meeting service needs of diverse groups of people across the U.S. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022). However, some University and College Counseling Centers (UCCCs) have rapidly rolled back telemental health provisions in favor of in-person or hybrid models of practice, even amidst increased use of counseling services, pressure to expand service availability, and difficulties with clinical staff retention (Gorman et al., 2020, 2021). To explore this phenomenon, 75 UCCC administrators in the U.S. were surveyed to elucidate the nature of remote staffing in UCCCs, including administrative perspectives regarding barriers to hiring permanently remote staff (PRS). Five thematic barriers to hiring PRS were identified: Institutional Roadblocks, Team Ethos, Equity in Clinical Duties, Student Demand, and Service Quality Concerns.

Patients admitted for ISH have a history of admissions for mental disorders without ISH. In addition, prior research indicates suicidal ideation is predictive of intentional self-harm. However, as much as 50% of suicidal ideation remains undisclosed in the medical setting. Objective: Describe hospital admissions associated with ISH, including typical mental health treatments provided and patterns of hospital admissions prior to the first ISH visit in 2019. Identify differences between those admitted prior to the ISH admission with and without suicidal ideation. Method: Retrospective study of all mental disorder related inpatient admissions in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's 2019 National Readmissions Database for patients with at least one admission for ISH in the second half of 2019. For patients admitted in July 2019 and later, mean durations between the first admission for ISH and the index admission in the prior 6 months for patients: with a primary mental disorder without any admissions for suicidal ideation (Group A); and with suicidal ideation (Group B) were computed. Results: A weighted population of 2,997 inpatients was derived (Group A: 1,212; Group B: 1,785). The mean duration between index admission and the first admission for ISH was 78 days in Group A and 83 days in Group B. The difference in group means of 5 days was statistically significant.

Further, we posit the three wellbeing components are first order factors of a higher order factor (evocative of Plato\u2019s notion of \u2018Justice\u2019), and collectively necessary for one to optimally function. We psychometrically compare this tripartite and higher order factor model alongside one and two factor models reflecting current wellbeing conceptualizations, using a US general population sample (N = 1,524) and a New Zealand Early Childhood Educator sample (N = 228). The tripartite model yielded the best psychometric qualities with both populations. We then tested the impact of three wellbeing components, and the higher order factor, on basic psychological needs, and workplace specific outcomes. As hypothesized, each wellbeing component had distinctly different relationships with the general and workplace context outcomes. Further, the higher order factor\u2019s collective impact on general and context specific outcomes overall supports our proposition that all wellbeing components are collectively necessary for one to optimally function and thrive. Our theory suggests the multitude of concepts and traits from wellbeing literature, may be interlinked, and apparent contradictions and jingle-jangle fallacies between existent wellbeing models may be resolved through a consistent and unifying framework.

Recently, the relationship between exteroception and interoception has been actively debated. The first evidence was a report that the susceptibility of the sense of ownership over a fake hand (i.e., illusory hand ownership: IHO) in the typical rubber hand illusion is negatively modulated by the accuracy of the heartbeat perception (i.e., cardiac interoceptive accuracy: CIA). If reliable, this would suggest an antagonism between the exteroceptive and interoceptive cues underlying the bodily self. However, some inconsistent data have been reported, raising questions about the robustness of the initial evidence. To investigate this robustness, we estimated the extent of the modulatory effect of CIA on IHO susceptibility by applying Bayesian hierarchical modeling to two independent datasets. Overall, our results did not support that IHO susceptibility is modulated by CIA. The present estimates with high uncertainty cannot exclude the hypothesis that the relationship between IHO susceptibility and CIA is so weak as to be negligible. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to reach a conclusion about the extent of the modulatory effect. These findings highlight the lack of robustness of key evidence supporting the \u201cantagonism hypothesis\u201d.","tags":["multisensory integration","rubber hand illusion","interoception","body ownership","bodily self"],"date":"2023-02-27T05:04:45.037221","doi":"10.1038\/s41598-023-43990-2","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Multisensory Integration","Perception","Embodied Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/rey4p\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/rey4p\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/rey4p","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/rey4p","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41598-023-43990-2","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_970"}
{"osf_id":"fr4ye","title":"Daily arousal variation has little effect on sustained attention performance","description":"Sustaining attention is an important cognitive process for everyday functioning and arousal is thought to underpin its performance. Primate studies depict an inverted-u relation between sustained attention and arousal, in which sustained attention performance is most affected at the extreme levels of arousal and peak performance aligns with moderate arousal. Human research findings are, however, inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the effects of arousal on sustained attention performance in humans using two approaches - a small-N study with an inbuilt replication to test within-participant variation, and a larger sample assessing between-participant variation. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) was used to measure sustained attention performance and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) was used to measure arousal. In the small-N study five participants completed the SART and KSS once an hour between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., repeated two weeks later. Significant, curvilinear variation in KSS across time-of-day was found. A linear association between SART response time variability (sigma) and KSS was noted, however no other consistent associations between the SART and KSS were found. In the large-N study, 161 participants completed the SART and KSS once, at a time of day of their choosing. There were no significant relations between SART measures and the KSS, indicating that subjective sleepiness was not related to sustained attention performance.

{"osf_id":"b3kt6","title":"A neuroanatomical and cognitive model of impaired social behaviour in frontotemporal dementia","description":"Impaired social cognition is a core deficit in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is most commonly associated with the behavioural-variant of FTD, with atrophy of the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Social cognitive changes are also common in semantic dementia, with atrophy centred on the anterior temporal lobes. The impairment of social behaviour in FTD has typically been attributed to damage to the orbitofrontal cortex and\/or temporal poles and\/or the uncinate fasciculus that connects them. However, the relative contributions of each region are unresolved. In this Review, we present a unified neurocognitive model of controlled social behaviour that not only explains the observed impairment of social behaviours in FTD, but also assimilates both consistent and potentially contradictory findings from other patient groups, comparative neurology and normative cognitive neuroscience. We propose that impaired social behaviour results from damage to two cognitively- and anatomically-distinct components. The first component is social-semantic knowledge, a part of the general semantic-conceptual system supported by the anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. The second component is social control, supported by the orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex and ventrolateral frontal cortex, which interacts with social-semantic knowledge to guide and shape social behaviour.","tags":["frontotemporal dementia","orbitofrontal cortex","social control","semantic dementia","social-semantic knowledge","anterior temporal lobe","anterior cingulate cortex","social behaviour"],"date":"2023-02-27T09:09:33.859523","doi":null,"subjects":["Clinical Neuroscience","Neuroscience"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/b3kt6\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/b3kt6\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/b3kt6","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/b3kt6","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_972"}
{"osf_id":"5s2yn","title":"Similarities and differences in attentional shifts induced by face-like objects and averted gaze faces","description":"In real life, people perceive non-existent faces from face-like objects, called face pareidolia. Face-like objects can capture the observer\u2019s visual attention and trigger attentional shifts like faces. However, studies do not determine whether attentional shifts induced by face-like objects are stemmed from social or symbolic information. Furthermore, the similarities and differences in the occurrence mechanism of attentional shifts induced by face and face-like objects remain unknown. To investigate this research question, our study used the gaze cueing task to compare the magnitude of cueing effects found in face-like objects and averted gaze faces. Our results suggested that both face-like objects and averted gaze faces triggered attentional shifts, although the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals could make attentional shifts via processing local features on both averted gaze faces and face-like objects. However, unlike averted gaze faces, individuals tend to process the holistic features of face-like objects to enhance the subsequent cueing effect. These findings provide new insight into the occurrence mechanisms underlying the perception of face-like objects, and how the brain represents a face even in the absence of physical facial stimuli.","tags":["holistic processing","attentional shifts","face pareidolia","local processing"],"date":"2023-02-27T10:13:21.296484","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Perception","Attention","Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/5s2yn\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/5s2yn\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/5s2yn","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/5s2yn","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_973"}
{"osf_id":"64kq5","title":"Normative Processing Needs Multiple Levels of Explanation: From Algorithm to Implementation","description":"Norms are the rules about what is allowed or forbidden by social groups. A key debate for norm psychology is whether these rules arise from mechanisms that are domain-specific and genetically inherited, or domain-general and deployed for many other non-norm processes. Here we argue for the importance of assessing and testing domain-specific and domain-general processes at multiple levels of explanation, from algorithmic (psychological) to implementational (neural). We also critically discuss findings from cognitive neuroscience supporting that social and non-social learning processes, essential for accounts of cultural evolution, can be dissociated at these two levels. This multi-level framework can generate new hypotheses and empirical tests of cultural evolution accounts of norm processing against purely domain-specific nativist alternatives.","tags":["cultural evolution","norm psychology","reinforcement learning","domain-general","social learning","cognitive neuroscience","norm processing","anterior cingulate cortex","domain-specific"],"date":"2023-02-27T11:01:43.365036","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Computational Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Life Sciences","Cognitive Psychology","Cultural Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Evolution"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/64kq5\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/64kq5\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/64kq5","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/64kq5","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_974"}

Testing New Method for Simulation of Eyewitness Experience with Virtual Reality Technology and Equipment","description":"Laboratory research in the psychology of witness testimony is often criticized for its lack of ecological validity, including the use of unrealistic artificial stimuli to test memory performance. The purpose of our study is to present a method that can provide an intermediary between laboratory research and field studies or naturalistic experiments that are difficult to control and administer. It uses Video-360\u00b0 technology and virtual reality equipment, which cuts subjects off from external stimuli and gives them control over the visual field. This can potentially increase the realism of the eyewitness's experience. To test the method, we conducted an experiment comparing the immersion effect, emotional response, and memory performance between subjects who watched a video presenting a mock crime on a head-mounted display (VR goggles; n = 57) and a screen (n = 50).  The results suggest that, compared to those who watched the video on a screen, the VR group had a deeper sense of immersion, that is, of being part of the scene presented. At the same time, they were not distracted or cognitively overloaded by the more complex virtual environment, and remembered just as much detail about the crime as those viewing it on the screen. Additionally, we noted significant differences between subjects in ratings of emotions felt during the video. This may suggest that the two formats evoke different types of discrete emotions. Overall, the results confirm the usefulness of the proposed method in witness research.","tags":["Immersion","eyewitness testimony","VR","methodology"],"date":"2023-02-27T12:30:11.965468","doi":"10.3758\/s13428-023-02186-2","subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other","Forensic","Forensic and Legal Psychology"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wqxhc\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wqxhc\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wqxhc","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wqxhc","doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3758\/s13428-023-02186-2","dataset_id":"psyarxiv_976"}

{"osf_id":"ydgqz","title":"Identifying dynamic shifts to careless and insufficient effort behavior in questionnaire responses; A novel approach and experimental validation","description":"Content Non-Response (CNR) is situation where participants respond to survey instruments without considering the item content. This phenomena adds noise to data leading to erroneous inference. There are multiple approaches to identifying and accounting for CNR in survey settings, of these approaches the best performing are model based classification techniques. Classic approaches to accounting for CNR treat it as a person level phenomena. They first use some method to identify participants who exhibit CNR, then use list-wise deletion to remove them prior to analysis. We argue that CNR is actually a state that participants may exhibit for a portion of a survey instrument. In other words, participants start a survey with the intention to follow instructions, but at some point transition to a CNR state and no longer respond in line with item contents. Accounting for CNR at the item level, as opposed to the person level preserves data resulting in increased power. \n\nIn this article we present a Bayesian Dynamic Latent Class Structural Equation Modeling (DLCSEM) approach for simultaneously accounting for CNR at the item level and estimating a model of interest. We use a simulation study to establish the approaches performance under empirically relevant conditions and to compare it to other methods. We then conducted an experimental validation in which we induce CNR like responses from human subjects and investigate the approaches ability to identify the point in which participants transition to a CNR state. We also compare the model to existing approaches.\n\nIn both the simulation and experimental validation the DLCSEM outperforms the alternative approaches. We conclude that the approach should be used by applied researchers for the pragmatic benefits of the method. Conclusions, limitations, and future directions are discussed.","tags":["Bayesian methods","dynamic latent class analysis","Inattention","Survey methods","Content Non-Response (CNR)","dynamic structural equation models"],"date":"2023-02-27T13:38:55.401353","doi":null,"subjects":["Quantitative Methods","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/ydgqz\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/ydgqz\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ydgqz","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ydgqz","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_978"}

However, the potential psychological benefits of capoeira have not previously been scientifically investigated. Inspired by research suggesting the benefits of exercise, meditation, yoga, and mindfulness practices, this pilot study investigated whether engagement in one session of capoeira was associated with altered state anxiety (SA), state self-efficacy (SSE), and prosocial behavior tendencies (PBT) compared to control activities of cooperative or combative movement or a non-movement control (acro-yoga, savate, and a graduate-level mathematics class).\nMethods: Capoeiristas (n = 117) and controls (n = 15) in the area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil completed self-report questionnaires measuring SA, SSE, and PBT before and after a session of capoeira or control activities. PBT was subdivided into pain-specific (helping a person in physical need) and money-lending-specific (loaning funds to someone in need) behavioral tendencies. The various control groups were combined due to their small\nsamples. Pre-post changes were analyzed and compared for capoeiristas vs. controls using mixed design ANOVAs. Results: One session of capoeira corresponded to a significant decrease in SA and an increase in state self- efficacy (pre- to post- session); however, this change did not differ significantly from similar pre- to post- session changes observed for the control activities. In contrast, there was a significant interaction of time (pre-post) and activity (capoeira vs. controls) for both overall PBT, F(1,120) = 11.32, P = .001, and pain-specific PBT, F(1,120) = 11.315, P = .0001. Specifically, while control participants appeared less likely to exhibit PBT after (vs. before) their sessions, no decrease in this behavior was observed after a session of capoeira.\nConclusion: While acknowledging limitations, such as the small samples and diverse nature of the control activities, this pilot study suggests the value of continued investigation into the potential effects of engaging in cooperative movement, such as capoeira, on certain psychological variables, particularly prosocial behavior tendencies. In addition to considering potential transient (state) effects, potential longitudinal effects of capoeira could also be of interest, as has been suggested for mindfulness and yoga practices.","tags":["acro-yoga","cooperative movement","movement","self-efficacy","prosocial behavior","savate","sports psychology","state anxiety","capoeira"],"date":"2023-02-27T14:32:42.055645","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Sport Psychology","Interpersonal Relationships","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Well-being","Prosocial Behavior"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/zdmes\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/zdmes\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/zdmes","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/zdmes","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_980"}

{"osf_id":"n6m5r","title":"No clear evidence of a difference between individuals who self-report an absence of auditory imagery and typical imagers on auditory imagery tasks","description":"Aphantasia is characterised by the inability to create mental images in one\u2019s mind.  Studies investigating impairments in imagery typically focus on the visual domain. However, it is possible to generate many different kinds of internal representation, including imagined auditory, kinesthetic, tactile, motor, taste and other experiences. Recent studies show that individuals with aphantasia report a lack of imagery in modalities, beyond vision, including audition.  However, to date, no research has examined whether these reductions in self-reported auditory imagery are associated with decrements in tasks that require auditory imagery.  Understanding the extent to which visual and auditory imagery deficits co-occur can help to better characterise the core deficits of aphantasia and provide an alternative perspective on theoretical debates on the extent to which imagery draws on modality-specific or modality-general processes.  In the current study, individuals that self-identified as being aphantasic and matched controls, performed two tasks requiring auditory imagery: a musical pitch-based and voice-based imagery task. The majority of participants with aphantasia self-reported significant deficits in both auditory and visual imagery.  However, we did not find a concomitant decrease in performance on tasks which require auditory imagery, either in the full sample or only when considering those participants that reported significant deficits in both domains.  These findings are discussed in relation to the mechanisms that might obscure observation of imagery deficits in auditory imagery tasks in people that report reduced auditory imagery.","tags":["Aphantasia","audition","visual imagery","musical imagery","voice representation","pitch","imagery","auditory imagery","voice"],"date":"2023-02-27T15:01:41.682667","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Imagery"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/n6m5r\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/n6m5r\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/n6m5r","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/n6m5r","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_982"}

In three preregistered studies, one correlational and two experimental, we investigated the relationship between (plastic) litter and restoration after a walk. In Study 1, participants did a self-selected restorative walk and afterwards reported observed litter. In two experimental studies, we manipulated the presence of plastic waste, biowaste (which served as an active control condition with human-sourced but degradable litter), and no waste in a virtual (i.e., video; Study 2) and an imagined (Study 3) forest walk. In all studies, we assessed subjective restoration, current affect and connectedness to nature, attractiveness and preference of scenery, as well as plastic-related problem awareness, intentions, and policy support. Results showed that litter, especially from plastic, is associated with harmful changes in subjective restoration, affect, and the perception of the scenery. Connectedness to nature, as well as plastic-related problem awareness, intentions, and policy support were not affected by the presence of plastic. Thus, plastic pollution influences human wellbeing negatively, but did not affect factors important to reduce consumption.

{"osf_id":"th2rm","title":"Object meaningfulness increases incidental memory of shape but not location","description":"Prior research has shown that visual working memory capacity is enhanced for meaningful stimuli (i.e., real-world objects) compared to abstract shapes (i.e., colored circles). Furthermore, a simple feature that is part of a real-world object is better remembered than the same feature presented on an unrecognizable shape, suggesting that meaningful objects can serve as an effective scaffold in memory. Here, we hypothesized that the shape of meaningful objects would be better remembered incidentally than the shape of non-meaningful objects in a color memory task where identity itself is task-irrelevant. We used a surprise-trial paradigm in which participants performed a color memory task for several trials before being probed with a surprise trial that asked them about the shape of the last object they saw. Across three experiments, we found a memory advantage for recognizable shapes relative to scrambled and unrecognizable versions of these shapes (Exp. 1) that was robust across different encoding times (Exp. 2), and the addition of a verbal suppression task (Exp. 3). In contrast, when we asked about the location of objects in a surprise trial, we did not observe any difference between the two stimulus types (Exp. 4). These results show that identifying information about a meaningful object is encoded into working memory despite being task-irrelevant. This privilege for meaningful shape information does not exhibit a trade-off with location memory, suggesting that meaningful identity influences representations of visual working memory in higher-level visual regions without altering the use of spatial reference frames at the lower level.","tags":["meaningfulness","visual working memory","incidental working memory"],"date":"2023-02-27T16:29:48.481052","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Memory"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/th2rm\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/th2rm\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/th2rm","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/th2rm","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_987"}
{"osf_id":"t85vg","title":"Don't stay behind or you won't boost my N400","description":"When a participant and another person are both presented with a stimulus, five recent event-related potential (ERP) studies show that the participant may also consider the perspective this other person may have about the stimulus. Indeed, these studies reveal additional N400 activities in participants who are with such a person. Interestingly, the two most recent ones show that this is the case even when task instructions do not explicitly require a focus on the perspective of this other person. Moreover, they reveal that these social N400 increases can occur even if participants know that this person is having the same information as they have. However, in all these studies, participants could see this other person. Here, we looked at whether this sight is important or whether these social-induced N400 increases could be observed when participants know this other person is there but do not see him\/her as (s)he is placed a bit behind them. They had to decide whether the word ending short stories was coherent, incoherent or equivocal. In participants who were with the confederate (n = 50), the amplitudes of the N400s elicited by these endings were found to be like those of the participants who were alone (n=51). On the other hand, in both groups, equivocal endings did not elicit larger N400s than coherent endings but triggered larger late posterior positivities (LPPs), as in previous studies. The discussion focuses on the circumstances in which perspective taking occurs and on the functional significance of the N400 and the LPP.","tags":["N400","event-related potentials","LPP","social context","stimulus processing","inhibition"],"date":"2023-02-27T21:52:24.987923","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Personality Psychology","Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroscience","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Social Cognition"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/t85vg\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/t85vg\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/t85vg","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/t85vg","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_988"}
{"osf_id":"j7mt4","title":"How to build up big team science: A practical guide for large-scale collaborations","description":"The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of Big Team Science (BTS), endeavours where a comparatively large number of researchers pool their intellectual and\/or material resources in pursuit of a common goal. Despite this burgeoning interest, there exists little guidance on how to create, manage, and participate in these collaborations. In this paper, we integrate insights from a multidisciplinary set of BTS initiatives to provide a how-to guide for BTS. We first discuss initial considerations for launching a BTS project, such as building the team, identifying leadership, governance, tools, and open science approaches. We then turn to issues related to running and completing a BTS project, such as study design, ethical approvals, and issues related to data collection, management, and analysis. Finally, we address topics that present special challenges for BTS, including authorship decisions, collaborative writing, and team decision making.","tags":["big team science","CRediT","Psychological Science Accelerator","authorship","Strengthening Democracy Challenge","collaboration","ManyBabies","science of team science","meta-science"],"date":"2023-02-27T22:50:02.827841","doi":null,"subjects":["Meta-science","Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/j7mt4\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/j7mt4\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/j7mt4","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/j7mt4","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_989"}
{"osf_id":"a8gz3","title":"Independent, not irrelevant: Trial order causes systematic misestimation of economic choice traits.","description":"In fields spanning policy, medicine, and finance, it is increasingly common to guide individual interventions on measures of a person's decision-making characteristics. As the practical application of these measures grows, so have efforts to improve their robustness to ostensibly irrelevant contextual factors such as time of day or ephemeral motivational state. Here, we examine whether such instruments exhibit a fundamental context-dependence: namely, the order in which decision problems are presented. In three datasets evaluating decision-making under different forms of uncertainty, we find systematic, meaningful effects of trial order, which in many cases qualitatively change the measurement\u2019s psychological interpretation (e.g. from risk-seeking to risk-averse). We further examine how trial properties modulate this phenomenon and provide an augmented modeling framework to reliably characterize and correct for these effects.","tags":["decision making","behavioral economics","temporal discounting","risk tolerance","sequential effects","ambiguity"],"date":"2023-02-27T22:50:51.666121","doi":null,"subjects":["Cognitive Psychology","Social and Behavioral Sciences","Judgment and Decision Making"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/a8gz3\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/a8gz3\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/a8gz3","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/a8gz3","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_990"}

A pilot study.","description":"Non-specific chronic low back pain (NS CLBP) affects people of all ages, is a leading contributor of disability worldwide and generates a great economic burden. Coping styles and personality traits are an important factor that should be considered when choosing a rehabilitation approach. \nIn this study we use the MPI-subtypes of chronic pain patients who effectively can be categorized into Dysfunctional-, Adaptive Coper-, Interpersonally Distressed- and Average -types. The purpose was to investigate which of the selected MPI-subtypes have a positive or negative treatment response from a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation program, to enable us to make better and data driven decisions if special treatments is needed.\nIn total, 110 patients started the multidisciplinary rehabilitation program and 79 patients successfully completed the entire program, whereas 31 patients dropped out.\nResults show that participants that are considered the \u201cAverage type\u201d benefit more from a multidisciplinary treatment that other subtypes.\nWe recommend to continue the search with a greater dataset for predictors to influence treatment outcomes based on the applied multidisciplinary treatment.","tags":["Rehabilitation","pain management","subtypes"],"date":"2023-02-27T23:20:35.251205","doi":null,"subjects":["Social and Behavioral Sciences","Psychology, other"],"is_published":true,"self_url":"https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/preprints\/wp8su\/","html_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/preprints\/psyarxiv\/wp8su\/","preprint_doi_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/wp8su","iri_url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/wp8su","doi_url":null,"dataset_id":"psyarxiv_991"}
